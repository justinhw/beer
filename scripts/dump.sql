1	812	Hocus Pocus	11	116	4.5	Our take on a classic summer ale.  A toast to weeds, rays, and summer haze.  A light, crisp ale for mowing lawns, hitting lazy fly balls, and communing with nature, Hocus Pocus is offered up as a summer sacrifice to clodless days.\n\nIts malty sweetness finishes tart and crisp and is best apprediated with a wedge of orange.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

27	878	Full Moon Winter Ale	5	72	5.599999905	This full-bodied ale is brewed with roasted malts and a hint of Dark Belgian sugar for a perfectly balanced taste.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
28	935	Odell IPA	3	31	7	We took the traditional IPA, originally shipped from England to India in the 1700's, and made it bolder and more flavorful - American Style. We've added new varieties of highly aromatic American hops to create a distinctive bitterness profile and an incredible hop character.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
29	1271	Ornery Amber Lager	8	95	0	Ornery Amber is brewed with a blend of the finest European hops and gently roasted malts.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
30	935	Cutthroat Porter	2	25	4.800000191	Not quite a stout but definitely no lightweight, Cutthroat Porter is smooth and robust. Inspired by the classic London porters, we use dark roasted malts to create a deep, rich color and flavor that hint at chocolate and coffee. We named it Cutthroat Porter as our tribute to the Colorado state fish - with its own rich heritage and unmistakable dark coloring. And while we're big fans of small batches, here's to the currently threatened Cutthroat population reaching mass quantities.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
31	1271	Maple Nut Brown Ale Ale	3	38	0	Maple syrup is added to each barrel of Maple Nut Brown Ale to impart roasted sweetness balancing the nut flavor produced by chocolate malts.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

40	1307	Quelque Chose	5	70	8	Quelque Chose was launched in January 1996. This versatile beer was specifically developed as a winter beer because, when warmed to 70帰鲗C (160帰鲗F), it can be taken as a hot drink. On the other hand, on the rocks, it is a wonderful aperitif. The cherries are soaked for months in slightly bitter ale before being blended into the beer. Quelque Chose is made with dark roasted malts, and the end result is something commonly known as an authentic nectar. The most original of the Unibroue line, it is highly appreciated by winter-sports enthusiasts.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Brewed with real cacao, and spiced with cinnamon and sweet orange peel for a sensual delight. A brew to be sipped, savored, and enjoyed!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

58	1221	Furious Beer	3	31	6	Like Hops? You'll like this fire-hued beer. This is the beer I have always dreamed of making. This is the beer that would come to mind while spending the last two years tearing down walls, hanging sheetrock, moving kegs, power washing the ceilings, arguing with various agencies, and cutting the water main. \n\nWithout Golden Promise malt, made by family-owned Simpsons Malt, Furious would just be pissed off-ed. From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end. Oh yeah, it's about 6% alcohol and around 100 IBUs.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

59	1221	Bender Beer	3	38	5.099999905	This beer is an amalgamation of styles; brown/porter/apa. Five distinct malts, including two from Belgium, give this beer added complexity and depth. We also add oatmeal to this beer to give it a smooth texture not usually associated with this type of beer. We add large amounts of American finishing hops to give Bender a citrus hop aroma because... we like hops. This is a session beer weighing in around 5% alcohol and 25 IBUs. Grab one today, we think you will want another!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

It is brewed according to the classic wheat beer recipe: 60 % wheat malt and 40 % barley malt, top fermentation and in compliance with the Purity Law of 1516.  This fine yeast wheat beer specialty is a refreshing, natural and stimulating beer brand.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

124	441	Buzzsaw Brown	3	38	4.800000191	By 1915, Bend, Oregon, was alive with the sound of the buzz saw, as two of the country's largest pine sawmills set up shop on the banks of the Deschutes River.  The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. \n\nBuzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard day疚_宊爮仯緛_s work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.\n\n疚_宊爮佪廮紆zzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,疚_宊牼暲_ says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. 疚_宊爮佪彺_he unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.疚_宊牼暲_	2010-07-22 20:00:20

208	935	90 Shilling	1	7	5.300000191	We introduced 90 Shilling, our flagship beer, at our opening party in 1989. For a while, we'd been wondering - what would happen if we lightened up the traditional Scottish ale? The result is an irresistibly smooth and delicious medium-bodied amber ale. The name 90 Shilling comes from the Scottish method of taxing beer. Only the highest quality beers were taxed 90 Shillings. A shilling was a British coin used from 1549 to 1982. We think you'll find this original ale brilliantly refreshing, and worth every shilling.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Our far-flung Beer Rangers affectionately refer to our Fort Collins brewery as the Mothership, a name that conjures images of earth shot from space and the interconnectivity of it all. Mothership Wit is brewed with wheat and barley malt, as well as coriander and orange peel spicing resulting in a balance of citrus and sour flavors held in suspension by a bright burst of carbonation.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

335	935	Levity Amber Ale	3	33	5.099999905	Levity is our lighter take on the amber ale. Munich and honey malts give it a full-bodied flavor and a happy-go-lucky personality. Then we let the finishing hops shine, for a beer that's crisp instead of bitter, as many ambers are. Levity was named by our brewers partly for its light color - and partly for the way it just refuses to take itself too seriously. Hey, we could all use a little levity once in a while.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
336	935	Easy Street Wheat	11	116	4.599999905	Light and refreshing, Easy Street Wheat is an unfiltered American-style wheat beer. Leaving in the yeast gives the beer a nice, smooth finish and a slightly citrusy flavor. Easy Street Wheat gets its name by brewers "taking it easy" and not filtering the beer. However, for ultimate enjoyment, we encourage you to work just a little harder in pouring it: just pour 2/3 of the beer into a glass, swirl what's left to stir up the yeast, then pour the rest and enjoy.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
337	161	Boulevard Pale Ale	3	26	5.400000095	Boulevard Pale Ale is a smooth, fruity, well-balanced beer with year-round appeal.

Pale Ale is the first beer we brewed, and continues to be a perennial favorite.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

It has the special dry-hopping taste and aroma, so appreciated by beer lovers all over the world. It is one of the two main beers from De Dolle Brouwers throughout the year.

The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.\n\nSMELL:\nYou will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.\n\nTASTE:\nDiscover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana. The bitterness always remains in the background but in the end emerges delicately.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

This is a very intense wheat doppelbock with a complex spicy chocolate-like arome with a hint of banana and raisins. On the palate, you experience a soft touch and on the tongue it is very rich and complex, though fresh with a hint of caramel. It finishes in a rich soft and lightly bitter impression.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
401	905	New Belgium Trippel Belgian Style Ale	5	61	8.5	Our Trippel Belgian Style Ale (pronounced triple) opens with a bold blast of hops that slowly gives way to the fruity esters implied by our Belgian yeast strain. The Three Graces hand-painted on the label are Zeus疚_宊爮仯緛_s daughters Aglaia (splendor), Euphrosyne (mirth) and Thalia (good cheer). In the Belgian tradition of brewing singles, doubles and triples, Trippel is the strongest with the longest fermentation.

When Jeff and Kim first sampled the beer at the Lyons Folks Fest, reviews were mixed at best. One of founder Jeff疚_宊爮仯緛_s first two Belgian style homebrews (along with Fat Tire), Abbey is a Belgian dubbel (or double) brewed with six different malts and an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Abbey is bottle-conditioned, weighs in at 7.0% alcohol by volume, and pairs well with chocolate (or boldly served by itself) for dessert.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Fresh picked hops have to be added to the brew immediately and in abundance.  Roughly 270 pounds of Crystal hops from Doug Weathers' farm outside Salem, Oregon will be added to the 50 barrel batch in addition to some dry kilned whole flower hops.  That adds up to approximately 5.5 pounds of hops per barrel brewed.  Another deliciously interesting beer in our Bond Street Series.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Since that time, Hibernation has become the most sought-after winter beer in Colorado. Hibernation疚_宊爮仯緛_s massive flavors are so intense that it requires over three months of aging each year. Each summer, while our brewers are still spending their weekends in flip-flops and shorts, they prepare for July疚_宊爮仯緛_s Hibernation brewing schedule.\n\nWe cellar Hibernation until late October, when it reaches the peak of perfection. This lengthy aging process gives Hibernation its revered malty richness, complex hop profile and hearty warming character, which is perfect right out of the bottle or cellared for longer periods of time. Hibernation is a lively treat that really beats the winter chill. This scrumptious, collectible, and imminently cellarable ale is only available for six weeks each year, from November 1 to December 15.

This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill 疚_宊爮仯屷� a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800疚_宊爮仯緛_s.

Hercules Double IPA is, however, an elixir fit for the gods. A brash but creamy wonder, Hercules pours a deep orange-coppery color, forming substantial lace in the glass. Hercules Double IPA delivers a huge amount of piney, floral, and citrusy hop aroma and flavor from start to finish. A hefty backbone of nutty, toffee-like malt character balances Hercules疚_宊爮仯緛_ aggressive, punchy hop profile.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

The morning of the scheduled hop delivery in Denver, Great Divide疚_宊爮仯緛_s brewers begin brewing Fresh Hop and are ready to hop the beer just as the fresh hops are delivered.\n\nUsing fresh hops is a big endeavor, requiring four to five times the volume of hops compared to the usual process of using pelletized hops. This complex process brings impressive results: Fresh Hop is an American-Style Pale Ale with moderate hop bitterness marked by a unique and intensely grassy hop flavor and aroma. Fresh Hop is a superbly refreshing, medium bodied, light-copper colored pale ale.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Inversion I.P.A.'s trio of American hops delivers an over-the-top nose with hints of orange and grapefruit.  Inversion is then dry-hopped for seven days resulting in an added hoppy kick.  To balance the hop character, Deschutes疚_宊爮仯緛_ brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. \n\nJust like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.

480	757	M荆示懒nchshof Premium Schwarzbier	7	86	4.900000095	Schwarzbier means "black beer" in German. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a "black Pils," but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\n\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
481	296	St. Bernardus Tripel	5	61	8	This beer, with high fermentation, has a pale amber colour and a flowery, fruity taste with a harmonious balance between sweet and sour (8% alcohol content). \nThis beer has a thick and vivid froth and strikes by its balanced taste with a delicate bitterness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

It is only brewed about once per year, representing approximately 1% of total beer production, thus is quite difficult to obtain.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

487	262	Westmalle Trappist Tripel	5	61	9.5	Was first brewed in 1934 and the recipe has not changed since 1956. It is made with pale candy sugar and has a very pale color produced from a mash of light pilsener malts. Styrian Goldings hops are used along with some German varieties and the classic Saaz pilsener hop. After a long secondary fermentation, the Tripel Westmalle is bottled with a dose of sugar and yeast. This beer holds up well in the bottle over time and seems to soften with age.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

764	526	Organic India Pale Ale	3	31	6.699999809	Fish Tale Organic India Pale Ale is a medium-bodied beer with a rich golden color. The organic pale and crystal malts lay down a firm malt body. This provides the backbone for an assertive hop profile featuring organic Pacific Gem. The moment the Mighty Fish Brewers sampled this pungent and resinous New Zealand hop, they knew it would be perfect for their Organic I.P.A. The result: A Cascadian treasure.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Its organic pale, Munich, and crystal malts create a gentle sweet character that is difficult to resist.  From organic Hallertauer hops come a zesty flavor and aroma that beautifully balance Organic Amber's malt profile. The result: Truly delicious ale that salutes organic farmers and all the goodness they bring to our tables.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

833	604	Yeti Imperial Stout	3	43	9.5	Traditionally, Imperial Stouts, the biggest and boldest of all stouts, were brewed with massive amounts of roasted malts and hops, resulting in a velvety smooth but robust beer characterized by high alcohol content and extremely high hop bitterness. Meeting the challenge of this aggressive, challenging beer style, Great Divide疚_宊爮仯緛_s Yeti Imperial Stout is an onslaught of the senses. An almost viscous, inky-black brew, Yeti opens with a massive, roasty, chocolate, coffee malt flavor that eventually gives way to rich toffee and burnt caramel notes. Packed with an enormous quantity of American hops, Yeti疚_宊爮仯緛_s hop profile reveals a slightly citrusy, piney, and wonderfully dry hoppy finish.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Instead, we brew Titan IPA for hop disciples 疚_宊爮仯屷� independent beer drinkers seeking out robust, flavorful beers characterized by their abundance of hops flavor, aroma and bitterness. As a big, aggressively hopped India Pale Ale, Titan IPA fills this bill 疚_宊爮仯屷� beginning with piney hop aromas and citrus hop flavors, and finishing with a rich, malty sweetness that is carefully balanced with crisp hop bitterness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

942	823	Schuylkill Punch	11	121	6	Ruby colored ale fermented with over 500 pounds of real black and red raspberries for a distinct berry aroma and a tart, sweet flavor.

943	823	Nokdechiloff	3	35	12.69999981	This winter warmer will knock the chill away until summer. It used as much malt as our brew house can handle and armloads of fresh hops and lovingly laid in our fermentor for four months. Massively malty and balanced with burly bitterness it is truly the king of beers, approaching wine in strength. A definitive one to have when you疚_宊爮仯緛_re only having one. Adoringly served in brandy snifters to preserve precious properties.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Our interpretation is orange-gold in color, lightly bitter but highly hoppy with a firm malt backbone. \nWe疚_宊爮仯緛_ll gladly put this head-to-head with the best that those California Hophead/Brewers have to offer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
945	823	Manayunk Lager	7	84	6.400000095	In strict accordance with the German purity law of 1516, we present to you this annually brewed festbier. Traditionally brewed in March and stored deep in the caves of Germany, this beer was brought to the masses to celebrate in October.

Copper-orange in color, it sports a toasty malt backbone that wonderfully compliments itself with many of our menu items.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
946	823	Brilliant Barstool	1	1	5.099999905	A true English session ale brewed in the pale ale style using ye olde techniques of yesteryear. Specially crafted to inspire you and your thirstiest mates barstool conversations. Light copper in colour. This pint is quite malty with just enough East Kent hops for a nice, earthy hoppiness. Naturally cask conditioned, this may be served a little cold for a true Brit but is a \ncomplimentary double nod to one of the 1st beer styles. Cheers mate!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

980	409	Golden Treasure	3	37	4.199999809	For those who enjoy a clean, crisp, refreshing beer this medium copper colored brew is perfect. With its low level of hop bitterness and slightly sweet flavor it is one of our lightest ales. We use the lightest grains with Kent Goldings and Liberty hops.

1238	524	Double Barrel Ale	3	33	5	A British Pale Ale never tasted so fresh. We challenge our good friends across the pond to match this one. Can疚_宊爮仯緛_t be done. We疚_宊爮仯緛_ve honored the traditions of the great British Pale brewers of Burton-on-Trent using our patented Firestone Union oak barrels. You疚_宊爮仯緛_re left with a mild blend of vanilla and toasted oak flavor touched with an elegant hint of English noble hops. DBA is the flagship of our company and wildly popular.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
1239	404	Island Pale Ale (IPA)	3	31	7	Our Islander IPA is a powerful West Coast IPA. This beer bites back with an intense hoppy zing and high alcohol content. The Islander IPA is dry hopped with tons of Centennial & Chinook hops and its fruity aroma will win your approval.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
1240	404	Point Loma Porter	2	25	0	A robust porter, very dark in color and a roasted malt flavor from chocolate malts. Its slight bitterness is rightfully balanced with a sweet smooth finish. A full-bodied beer with medium hop bitterness and aroma.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1257	1204	Smoked Porter	2	25	5.900000095	Stone Smoked Porter is dark, rich and complicated. A porter is substantially darker than a pale ale, but not as black or opaque as a stout. Our Smoked porter has a captivatingly deep mahogany color, complimented by silky dark tan head. Rich, full bodied and robust. Smooth, with chocolate and coffee-like flavors balanced by the subtle "smoky" character of just the right amount of peat-smoked specialty malt.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
1258	1204	Stone Pale Ale	3	26	5.400000095	Our flagship ale, Stone Pale Ale is our Southern California interpretation of the classic British pale ale style. Deep amber in color, Stone Pale Ale is robust and full flavored. A delicate hop aroma is complemented by a rich maltiness. This is an ale for those who have learned to appreciate distinctive flavor. Stone Pale Ale is great by itself, or with food that requires a beer of character.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1377	520	Roundabout Oatmeal Stout	1	21	6	Everyone has their price. For some, it's measured in dollars per hour, for others it's powder days. For those that have the gift of passion for the dark side, it's measured in pints of Oatmeal Stout. Another one of FiftyFifty's seasonals, the Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is brown to black in color and nearly opaque. It has a velvet like mouthfeel, moderate hints of dark dried fruit, espresso beans and Dark Chocolate... and just a hint of hop bitterness. The addition of Flaked Oats gives this brew its wonderful creamy texture. Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is one of a series of Stouts that FiftyFifty Brewing Co. will produce during the course of the year. Enjoy!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1432	1301	Chief Blackhawk Porter	2	25	5.599999905	In 1767 a great Sauk leader was born.  His name meant "the black sparrow hawk."  He came to be known as Black Hawk.  Strong beliefs, independent thinking and an unwavering commitment to his family and his people earned him a reputation as a man of integrity and courage.  In 1832, along with 1,200 of his people, Black Hawk was driven from his ancestral home during a war that bears his name.  We celebrate this Sauk leader and his courage with our BlackHawk Porter, the kind of beer that make you say, Ma-ka-tai-she-kia-kiak!\n\nChief BlackHawk Porter is a robust black and sharply bittersweet ale.  This style was traditionally the session beer consumed by the porters in London.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1549	520	Manifesto Pale Ale	3	26	5.300000191	We at FiftyFifty believe that beer is good. Especially this beer. Manifesto is one of FiftyFifty's flagship beers. This beer is a delight for those who take pleasure in craft beers and are looking for something that they can enjoy a few pints of. Manifesto has a restrained malt backbone of flavor with mild biscuit and caramel notes, and the hop character is light to moderate with mild earthiness evolving to a slightly more moderate citrus/piney finish. This is a beer of principle.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1553	94	Racer 5 IPA	3	31	7	This is a hoppy IPA. Did I say hops? Your brewer is a hop head! This is a full bodied beer using American grains. The goal was to create a base for showing off the unique floral qualities of two Pacific Northwest hops, Columbus and Cascade. Columbus is a new hybrid High Alpha Acid hop used mostly for bittering, but used heavily as an aromatic in this strong brew. Cascade is the balance that ties the malt and bittering hops together. It is a true specialty ale and is our brewer's statement on this style.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1557	94	Big Bear Black Stout	3	43	8.100000381	Big Bear, as the name implies, is a hefty, black, Russian Imperial-style stout. This bold stout boasts a rich, caramel sweetness lavished by a robust, deep-roasted heartiness you can sink your teeth into. ...Big Bear's bold flavors are produced using a blend of Belgian and English roasted barley and crystal malts. Some unique flavors come forth in the malt character. ...Louisiana sweet molasses and dark brown sugar. This dark brew is well hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops, which are somewhat, masked by the malt. This is a balanced bold brew boasting an A.V.B. of 8.1% that can creep up on you, "so don't get mauled". It has a dry roasted quality that masks its' high alchohol content, so drink responsibly. 2004 California State Fair, Silver Medal Winner; 2002 World Beer Cup, Gold Medal Winner; \n2002 Annual Bistro Beer Festival, Hayward, Gold Medal Winner; 2001 North American Brewers' Award, Honorable Mention - og 1.076, ABV 8.1%, IBU 68.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Reminiscent of dark chocolate, espresso, and dark dried fruits with a long complex finish, this beer is good for one of those nights where you've dug yourself into a snow bank because the ski trip didn't go quite as planned. Deep brown with mahogany highlights, the hops and malt are very well balanced leaving one to contemplate the myriad of flavors as the beer warms. Moderate to slightly heavy, this beer is heaven in a glass.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1805	905	1554 Enlightened Black Ale	5	72	5.5	Born of a flood and centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Enlightened Black Ale uses a light lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2222	193	Belzebuth	3	37	13	Beer of top fermentation, Belzebuth represents the achievement of a more than one hundred year-old know-how, the one of the Brewery Grain d'Orge. Under its copper colour, it hides a strong character for the lovers of sensations. It owes its strength to the subtle mixture of pure malts, hops and yeasts especially selected by our Master-Brewer.\n\nAt one time this beer was 15%. After the name change it was lowered to 13%.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2224	62	Hog Heaven Barleywine	3	35	9.199999809	This dangerously drinkable garnet beauty is a hop lover's delight.  The intense dry-hop nose and the alcohol content are perfectly balanced for a caramel candy-like malt finish.  This is a serious beer for serious beer afficianados and it only gets better with age.  Cellerable for 3 years.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2290	1301	Bitter Woman IPA	3	31	5.75	Lest we forget Aunt Cal, an early resident of Lake Mills.  Local history remembers her for blindly running into a hitching post and saying, "Excuse me, Dr. Dodge!"  It was said that she was an old sweetheart of the famous American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  And she still had the love letters to prove it!  Sadly, Aunt Cal never wed.  We brewed our Bitter Woman IPA the way we imagine Aunt Cal may have been, very fruity and intensely bitter.  So lift up a pint of Bitter Woman IPA and toast Aunt Cal and the bitter woman you know.  Cheers!\n\nBitter Woman IPA is our Wisconsin variation of an India Pale Ale.  This beer is intensely bitter with a mighty hop flavor and aroma.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Throughout the area, you疚_宊爮仯緛_ll find armies of fisherman, clad in blaze orange parkas and snowmobile suits, dragging their crudely built ice shanties onto the frozen lakes. While they vary in size, shape and color, each shanty contains an enthusiast braving the cold; spinning their tall tales; staring deeply into that hole in the ice; and, of course, enjoying a Legendary Wisconsin Beer. Brewed in the fall to help you survive our Wisconsin winters.\n\nShantytown Doppelbock is brewed in the style of a German Doppelbock. Brown in color with malty sweetness and a full body.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2447	68	Big Eye IPA	3	31	6	ndia Pale Ale is a style of beer that was developed in England during the period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\n\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\n\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\n\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2530	956	Gubna Imperial IPA	3	32	10	Emphasizing that complexity of character can arise from simple elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn疚_宊爮仯緛_t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

In cask, this beer has twice won CAMRA疚_宊爮仯緛_s Champion Beer of Scotland.\nOn the nose, this dark beer offers bitter chocolate, figs, toffee and hints of fruit.\n\nOn the palate, this resolves into beautiful, silky-smooth, coffee-and-chocolate flavours, followed by figs, dates and dried fruits, with a very appealing, lingering aftertaste of fruits and hop bitterness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2637	1301	Fighting Finches Bock	7	91	0	The Finches will get you if you don疚_宊爮仯緛_t watch out!" In the early days of southern Wisconsin, falling into the clutches of the "Fighting Finches" was the ultimate threat. Moses Finch fathered 21 offspring whose most notable talents were stealing horses and robbing stagecoaches. From their stronghold in the impenetrable marshes west of Lake Mills, the Finches raided the farms of local settlers and held up the early travelers between Madison and Milwaukee.\n\nThe Finches are long gone, but their legend lives on. So enjoy a pint of our Fighting Finches Bock疚_宊牼_ or you better watch out, 疚_宊爩_鰪禀ause the Finches are gonna get you!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
2638	1301	Stone Teepee Pale Ale	3	26	5.75	The legend of Tyranena began 3,000 years ago, with a group of pyramids and effigy mounds constructed in a remote valley formed by a vast, slow-moving glacier.  \n\nToday, these ancient "stone tepees" lie 60 feet below the surface of Rock Lake in Jefferson County, Wisconsin.  No one is certain how or why they were built, but many have speculated on their origin, purpose and the people who built them.  \n\nWe invite you to develop your own theories on the legend and mystery of Tyranena while enjoying a Stone Tepee Pale Ale.\n\n Stone Tepee Pale Ale is brewed in the tradition of an American pale ale.  This beer celebrates the American hop, with its characteristic bitterness, flavor and aroma.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

They blended dark and pale roasted malted barley with select hops and allowed for longer aging to create a robust beer with an exceptionally creamy head. Unchanged since 1888, You'll find our bock's sturdy bod and deep color perfect to draw you out of one season and the into next.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2816	157	Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat	4	50	5.300000191	For our take on the classic hefeweizen style our search for unique ingredients led us to the Eureka and Lisbon varieties of lemon grown in three different regions of California.  These particular lemons added the perfect balance of citrus tartness and sweetness to accent the taste of the beer.  The spiciness of the Hallertau Mittelfruh and Spalt Spalter hops balance out the slightly sweet character of our brewery疚_宊爮仯緛_s own signature wheat malt, resulting in a crisp and refreshing wheat beer with a subtle lemon aroma and flavor.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2886	111	Robertus	8	95	6	Christoffel Robertus is a low-fermenting ruby-red beer, brewed in the M荆蕩惟nchener-style. It is a malty, fresh beer with a light sweetness. The typical hop bitterness found in Blond, is very lightly present in Robertus. The use of an extensive amount of selected barley gives Robertus the special malty taste and aroma.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

2901	585	Bourbon County Stout	3	43	13	Brewed in honor of the 1000th batch at our original Clybourn brewpub. A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with thick foam the color of a bourbon barrel. The nose is an intense mix of charred oak, chocolate, vanilla, caramel and smoke. One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer. A great cigar beer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

3106	1091	Saint Arnold Brown Ale	3	38	5.300000191	A beautiful, deep copper brown ale. It has a full, malty body with hints of chocolate, a touch of sweetness and a light hop flavor. A complex malt character is created by combining five different types of malts. It has a rich, creamy head with a fine lace. The light fruitiness, characteristic of ales, is derived from a proprietary yeast strain. \n\nSaint Arnold Brown Ale is best consumed at 45-50帰骶冷 Fahrenheit.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

3108	953	Skullsplitter Ale	1	15	8.5	Skull Splitter is our strongest ale: which is named after Thorfinn Einarsson who was the 7th Viking Earl of Orkney. Sophisticated, satiny smooth with a deceptively light character, it is a tribute to our colourful forbear.\n\nOn the nose, this strong beer has a fruity malt character, with hints of dark fruit, spicy hop, dates and figs.\n\nOn the palate, rich and complex with sweet toasted malt, molasses, fresh and dried fruit and hints of warming spices.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

3389	1091	Saint Arnold Texas Weat	\N	\N	3.900000095	A refreshing, flavorful filtered wheat beer. The perfect beer to accompany a meal or for a summer's day. The wheat contributes a lighter flavor while maintaining a rich body. The beer has a light hop profile -- just enough to give the beer balance and complexity. The light fruitiness is derived from a K荆示懒lsch yeast strain. A chill haze may be present, which is a characteristic of wheat beers. \n\nSaint Arnold Texas Wheat is best consumed at 40-45帰骶冷 Fahrenheit.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

3602	157	Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic	5	70	5.900000095	Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic is a fruit beer that draws its flavor not just from the cranberries it is brewed with, but also from the unique fermentation character imparted by the rare wild yeast strain. The result is a flavor rich in fruitiness and reminiscent of cranberries and bananas, cloves and nutmeg. The yeast fermentation also will create a slight sourness on the sides of the palate, a signature of the original Lambic style which, with the subtle cereal note from the wheat malt, remind its drinker that, as fruity a beer as this is, it is still a beer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

3920	1352	Merry Monks	5	61	9.300000191	Merry Monks' Ale is a Belgian style Abby Trippel without limitation.  This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.\n\nWhen you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry , begging for the next sip.\n\nYou might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies. Enjoyed best around 48 degrees F, it also makes a fine after-dinner drink.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3921	1352	Winter Ale	11	141	5.599999905	At Weyerbacher we've created a Winter Ale that is a must for any malty beer lover. Winner of a Silver Medal in the 1998 World Beer Championships, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is brewed with deep-roasted chocolate malt. The taste predominates with a warm, roasty flavor, balanced out with a slightly dry finish. It's smooth but not cloying, with a warming belt of alcohol (5.6% ABV).\n\nAlthough winter ales predate history, they are believed to have their origin in the pagan celebrations of winter solstice. Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.\n\nGenerally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3922	1352	AutumnFest	7	84	5.400000095	AutumnFest is Weyerbacher's own unique twist on the German Oktoberfest style. Copper-amber in color, AutumnFest is made with Vienna and Munich malts for that authentic, Bavarian easy drinking taste.  Each sip imparts a wonderful roastiness of malt on the tongue followed by a smooth, consistent finish.  Wonderfully balanced with a clean, velvety, slightly fruity taste, AutumnFest is the perfect beer for the Fall- a nice transition between the lighter beers of summer and the darker, heavier winter brews. It's a favorite of many Weyerbacher aficionados, who anticipate the end of summer with this wonderful beer. \n\n   Weyerbacher AutumnFest ( ABV 5.4%) is generally available in stores August through December.  Pick up a case to celebrate the change of seasons. Prost!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3923	1352	Black Hole	2	25	7	Coming in at an ABV of 7.0%, Our Black Hole satisfies the transition from dark ale to stout. We think of this as slightly "Porter-ish" with a strong malt body and a very light hop finish. This is brewed year round and is available in Pennsylvania in the regular Variety Pack.  This will help the ale drinker among us maintain their own balance!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3924	1352	Blanche	5	67	5	Clean, refreshing and perhaps just a bit tart, our brewers developed Weyerbacher Blanche just after their trip to Belgium during the winter of 2000.  Blanche, meaning "white", takes its name from the whitish haze in this pale gold brew, which is a result of the raw wheat and wheat malts used to brew this Belgian-style beer. \n\nIn 2002, Blanche was named as Best of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast in the Belgian Specialty category at the US Beer Tasting Championships.\n\nWhite beers are well known as the principal product from Hoegaarden, a small town in a wheat-growing region east of Brussels.  Light, cloudy and smooth, Weyerbacher Blanche brings you authentic Belgian-style flavor along with microbrewed quality and freshness.\n\nBlanche is a thirst quenching beer that combines character and flavor with a moderate alcohol content.  Just try a bottle.  In the nose you'll notice spiciness from the coriander seeds and dried curacao orange peels added during the boil.  In the mouth you'll find a mild and refreshing ale with a hint of dryness from the wheat ingredients.  A clean finish follows with just a hint of tart spiciness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3925	1352	Blasphemy	5	62	11.80000019	First released in March 2007,  Blasphemy is our award winning QUAD aged in bourbon barrels.  But not overaged, so we've picked up gentle vanilla oaky notes which complement rather than supercede the complex qualities that already make QUAD such an incredible beer.  Expected to be an annual Spring seasonal, supplies are limited.  ABV is 11.8%.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3926	1352	Blithering Idiot	3	35	11.10000038	At Weyerbacher, we prefer to brew things true to European style guidelines. Consequently our barley wine is  on the malty side, yet not  overly sweet. Notes of date or perhaps fig on the palate follow a pleasurably malty aroma to your taste buds. The finish is warm and fruity, and begs for the next sip.\n\nEnjoy Blithering Idiot in a brandy snifter or wine glass, preferably in front of the fire, or accompanying a literary classic. This is the finest life has to offer and should be treated as such. Moments of reflection make all the toil worthwhile, and Blithering Idiot is for moments like these. Share it with your family over the holiday dinner. Lay a few down, aging only helps a barley wine develop more class. At 11.1 % ABV (alcohol by volume) this fine ale will keep for years. Our expected maximum shelf-life is 2 to 3 years. Although it might see a decade, beyond the 3rd year most barley-wines have a tendency to decrease in complexity, so don't wait too long	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3927	1352	Decadence	3	33	13	Decadence is our Tenth Anniversay spiced amber ale.  This is a very limited production, brewed only once, to celebrate ten fantastic years in business.  This ale weighs in at 13% ABV and is a fantastic sipper, especially after dinner or consider paring it with a good book on a cool fall evening.  Decadence is brewed with honey, cardamom spice and gentian (a rare botanical!)  This ale is very unique and will develop finer character when aged at cellar temperatures.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3928	1333	Oatmeal Stout	1	21	5.5	Pours a very deep black with a pleasant aroma and a thick brown head.  It has the usual coffee taste you would expect with a hint of chocolate.  There is quite a lot of carbonation but is very drinkable.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3956	541	HopFish IPA	3	31	6.199999809	At the request of you hopheads, we produced this I.P.A. with a deep golden color, plenty of hop bitterness balanced by malt sweetness. Because of the extensive dry hopping, there's a floral and citrus hop finish. It's then lightly filtered to maintain the appropriate body and flavor. The beer features a combination of American, English and German malts to balance the large amount of hops. The HopFish also uses three hop varieties at five different times and has been dry-hopped for two weeks with 22lbs of Nugget whole leaf hops.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3978	2	South Park Blonde	3	37	5	Light golden color. Sweet dry aroma with crisp, clear bitterness. Brewed with imported German hops.The perfect beer to have when you'd like to have more than one.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3929	1352	Double Simcoe IPA	3	32	9	Double Simcoe IPA, 9.0% abv, is our incredible reward for Hopheads seeking over the top flavor in a Double IPA, without the harshness. Brewed  with Simcoe hops, developed and trademarked by Select Botanicals Group, LLC, in the year 2000. This hybrid hops was created to allow maximum aromatic oils, along with low cohumulone(harshness) levels, so that brewers can really load up a lot of 'em in a beer and not have any harshness. The piney, citrusy notes are all here, and in a very clean (non-harsh) way, as well as having an aroma with impact. Introduced by Weyerbacher in 2005 originally as a seasonal, this brew has garnered numbers so high on Beer Advocate, and been in such high demand by consumers,  we decided to add it to our year-round line-up in March 2007. Check it out, and you'll soon see why everyone's talking about it.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3930	1352	Eleven	5	61	11.69999981	Our Eleventh anniversy ale, released in July 2006 only is a Triple IPA made exclusively with Phoenix hops. 11.7% abv make this Triple IPA powerful, but the Phoenix hops keep it smooth.  Phoenix is another one of those hops with low cohumulone levels, which means  when used in very large quantities (as we do in Eleven) the hops flavor is very smooth, not a hint of harshness for the enormous amounts of hops in the brew.  As with all of our Anniversay ales, this one will age fantastically and will never be made again, as each anniversary is an entirely different brew.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3931	1352	Heresy	3	43	8	This incredibly intriguing Imperial Stout is made by aging our Old Heathen in some very famous Oak barrels that were used for aging bourbon! What do we have when we are done? A stout whose very essence has been enhanced. A stout whose complexity has been increased. A stout with notes of Oak, whiskey and vanilla melding together to create a new sensation. Have we gone too far this time? We don't think so. Heresy is a step above and a leap beyond the extraordinary. Taste it and see what everyone is talking about. 8.0% ABV	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3932	1352	Hops Infusion	3	31	6.199999809	Hops Infusion is loaded with piney, citrusy notes, much hops complexity, and a strong foundation of malt underneath it all.. Glowing a deep amber color, Hops Infusion is brewed with seven types of hops. Simcoe, Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, Saaz, Fuggles and E. Kent Goldings give this beer the complexity that's so interesting. Our brewers intention on Hops Infusion was to create a complexity of hops flavor and aromas, not found in any other beer.\n\nOriginally developed for our BrewPub (no longer open), Hops Infusion was ahead of its time in 1998, but eventually became over shadowed by plethora of entries from other brewers in the India Pale Ale category, with everyone pushing the envelope on hops content more and more. So, in late 2005 we redesigned this beer with an entirely new recipe and new packaging as well. The results are unmistakable, Hops Infusion is clearly a leading IPA once again.\n\nWe brew Hops Infusion (6.2% ABV, 1.068 OG) all year 'round. So if your local beer store doesn't have it, tell 'em to get moving!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3933	1352	House Ale	3	33	4.5	House Ale, our 4.5% session ale, was first brewed in 2006.  Our goal was to brew a beer that was a little bit lower in alcohol, but did not lack for body and flavor. We're sure you'll agree, that's just what we achieved with this tasty brew.  Brewed with Pale, Caramunich, and Carapils malt for flavor and body, then hopped exclusively with expensive Tettnang hops, a very delicate, delicious hops that perfectly fits this beer with just the right snap of flavor.   Available only in Pennsylvania, in our Variety Pack Case.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3934	1352	Imperial Pumpkin Ale	11	123	8	Yes that's right!  The mother of all Pumpkin Ales is currently in transit to our wholesalers and should be out on shelves around mid-September.  This 8.0% ABV pumpkin ale is heartier, spicier, and more "caramelly" and "pumpkiny" than its faint brethren!  \n  Perfect finisher on a cool autumn night, or match it up with a slice of pumpkin pie and fresh whipped cream.  \n  If you don't agree this is the mother of all pumpkin ales, then you just don't like mothers!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3935	1352	Insanity	3	35	11.10000038	Insanity, just released this past November, 2004, is Weyerbacher's latest creation in the world of cutting edge beers. Insanity is made by aging our perfectly balanced Blithering Idiot Barleywine in  oak bourbon casks. This incredible combination creates a melange of flavors such as malt, dates, oak, vanilla, and bourbon just to name a few.\n\n  Insanity is 11.1% ABV. It is best enjoyed in a brandy snifter and served at 45-50 degrees F.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3936	1352	Muse Farmhouse Ale	5	74	6.199999809	Muse, a Farmhouse Ale,  is brewed "somewhat" in the tradition of the style, but it has Weyerbacher fingerprints all over it! Made with Pale malt, a little carapils, raw wheat and raw oats, this warm weather seasonal is dry and ever so slightly tart on the pallet from the wheat and oats. At 6.2% abv, its a bit higher than your strictly traditional farmhouse, but not out of the realm, really. The wheat and oats makes the mouthfeel silky and light at the same time.  They also bring some cloudiness to the brew, but don't be afraid!  Hopped with Styrian Goldings and finished with Saaz, this beer has a noticable hoppy dryness which makes it a fine thirst quencher, something the original Farmhouse Ales were intended to be, served to workers out in the fields on hot summer days as a restorative.\nFermented with Forbidden Fruit yeast, at a very high temperature (78F), the spiciness developed is entirely from this traditional yeast strain, not from any kettle additions. Unfiltered, to enjoy this natural beauty, and imagine yourself out in the flat fields of Belgium! Cheers!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3937	1352	Old Heathen	3	43	8	Rich, velvety and deliciously complex, Old Heathen is a truly distinctive winter warmer. We use seven types of malt and two varieties of hops to bring forth this big brew. Quite robust and roasty on the palate, Old Heathen imperial stout has a wonderfully fruity nose and a moderately dry finish. The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate. \n\nOld Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age.\n\nLike most of our beers, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods. Try it with rich stews, oysters, caviar or roasted meats. Old Heathen is also a perfect companion to chocolate desserts.\n\nOld Heathen is now available year-round.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3938	1352	Prophecy	5	61	9.300000191	Prophecy is our third ale to be aged in bourbon barrels. We've taken our Merry Monks' Ale and carefully aged it in bourbon barrels. The result is a fabulous unique ale, softened with hints of vanilla and oak, with an intriguing finish to it. Prophecy is a limited release so when it's here, be sure to grab a case or two to lay away before its gone. 9.3% ABV.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3979	2	Bitter American	1	4	3.599999905	An American session beer. Loaded with hop character and a malty presence, but lower in alcohol.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3939	1352	Quad	5	62	11.80000019	Grand Champion in the 2000, and again in 2004 at United States Beer Tasting Championship, Weyerbacher QUAD is the first quadrupel style beer to be commercially brewed and bottled in the United States.\n\nIn December 2002 QUAD won Mid-Atlantic Champion at the USBTC for the third year in a row.\n\nMassively big and delicious, QUAD is an elegant and dark ale. Rich with complexity and flavor, try savoring it after a long day or during a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine elixir. QUAD, with an alcohol content of 11.8% (by volume) is the strongest beer we make, so please pay proper accord as you enjoy it.\n\nAs with any higher alcohol beers, QUAD will be at its best after a period of 6 or 12 months in the bottle, perhaps longer. We expect a shelf life of 3-5 years, but go ahead, we know you can't wait (we couldn't either). Enjoy one now, and another every month or two, and you'll be truly amazed as QUAD gains smoothness and complexity over time as it ages.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3940	1352	Raspberry Imperial Stout	3	43	8	Enjoyed alone as a winter-warmer or as the perfect finish to any fine meal, our Raspberry Imperial Stout is a wonderfully full-flavored beer with just a "kiss" of raspberry flavor. \nWhen we brew this beer we add just a touch of real raspberries during the fermentation process. The result is a modest fruit flavor which enhances--- without dominating the rich, malty, stout taste.\n\nOur Raspberry Imperial Stout (8.0% ABV) is great alone or as an after-dinner accompaniment. It's especially good with chocolate desserts. We brew it only during the winter months, so check out the Brewing Schedule on the "What's New"  page for the next time it will be coming to a beer store near you.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3941	1352	Twelve	3	35	10.19999981	Our 12th anniversary brew is a Rye Barleywine.  Checking in at 10.2% abv, Twelve is being released in July and through the end of the year.   Made from 50% Rye Malt and 50% Barley Malt, this strong ale is extremely viscous. The rye adds a tantalizing note of flavor on the palate with a hint of tartness you've come to expect from Rye.  Slightly warm when its young, the beer will age very well, perhap 5 years or more.  We're guessing that peak taste will be in the 1 to 2 year old range, with 3 and 4 not far behind.  Be sure to lay some down in your collection.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3942	157	Samuel Adams OctoberFest	7	84	5.699999809	The first thing you notice when pouring a glass of this seasonal beer is the color. Samuel Adams帰骶繽 Octoberfest has a rich, deep golden amber hue which itself is reflective of the season. Samuel Adams帰骶繽 Octoberfest is a malt lover's dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops. Samuel Adams帰骶繽 Octoberfest provides a wonderful transition from the lighter beers of summer to the winter's heartier brews.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3943	157	Samuel Adams Scotch Ale	1	15	5.400000095	This is a brew for adventurous beer drinkers. It is brewed with four malts: two row pale Harrington, Munich malt, chocolate malt, and a rare peat smoked malt commonly used by distillers of Scotch malt whiskey. This unique malt gives Samuel Adams纠_ Scotch Ale its distinct, subtle smoky character and deep amber hue. Samuel Adams纠_ Scotch Ale is brewed using traditional English hops, Goldings and Fuggles. This is a big brew dominated by malt flavors and aromas, rich and full bodied, slightly sweet. Its layered malt complexity lingers to a smooth and silky finish.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3944	540	Garde Dog	\N	\N	5.800000191	Proving the French may actually know something we don't... Garde Dog is a traditional French Biere de Garde or "beer for keeping".

The enticing regal aromas of toffee and licorice lead to the coronation of taste; a palate of malty richness exhibiting chocolate and coffee notes, balanced by the noble and novel Mt. Rainer hop, all topped with a rich creamy crown. This very special offering will warm your soul and lift your spirits. Oh yeah, it also packs a royal kick at 8% alcohol.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
3954	305	Duchesse de Bourgogne	\N	\N	6.199999809	DUCHESSE DE BOURGOGNE\nfrom Brouwerij Verhaeghe is the traditional Flemish red ale.

Malty and roasty on the palate, and with distinctive caramel notes, this beer will satisfy the desires of any malty beer aficionado. \n\nWeyerbacher Scotch Ale is our interpretation of a beer style originating from Scotland, where the chilly damp weather calls for a hearty beer. Lacking the preservative powers of hops, scotch ales were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.7% ABV (alcohol by volume) Weyerbacher Scotch Ale definitely contains a warming belt.\n\nWe brew Weyerbacher Scotch Ale mostly in the cooler months of the year. Check out the Upcoming Events and Beers page for the next time it will be at a beer store near you.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

A festive-occasion beer, brown ale is one of the oldest English brewing styles, mentioned in literature in the 16th century.

4066	551	Belgian Wit	5	67	0	Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced "Who Garden") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!\n\nBelgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. \n\nYou will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove. Our version of a Belgian Wit is called "Hoof - Hearted Wit," and it is brewed to style with dried bitter and sweet orange peel and coriander seeds.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4068	551	Black Betty Schwartzbier	7	86	5	This almost black lager originates from Germany and is most closely associated with Porter. The difference being the long maturation period (or lagering time) required to produce a true Schwartzbier. The flavor is reminiscent of treacle, coffee and toasted malt. It is not and should not be perceived as burnt or ashy like some stouts. Black Betty has 5% alc/vol and a smooth character that marks most lager beers.\n\nThe name, of course, comes from the Huddy Ledbetter song from the 1940疚_宊爮仯緛_s which was made popular by the band Ram Jam and later by the Black Crows and U2, among others.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4095	858	Arctic Devil Barley Wine	\N	\N	13.19999981	Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is typically brewed in January then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released on the Friday after Thanksgiving. \n\nIn its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table. \n\nEach annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment. \n\nMidnight Sun's elusive Arctic Devil Barley Wine is Alaska's most awarded barley wine.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Hedonistic!"Mellow Beer Emboldened by Hops," Elaine Louies article in the New York TimesDining Out Section, (March 24, 1999) announced the release of latest Rogue elixir to be bottled.

There is nothing brutal about the rich, deep, mellow taste. Its crackling but not sharp... This beer may raise eyebrows, but it wont pucker lips. The aftertaste is clean."\n\nRogue brewer John Maier describes his Brutal Bitter as a cross between a Very Extra Special Bitter and an Indian Pale Ale. Brutal Bitter was first brewed in 1996 for the 20th Anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Customer demand prompted Rogue to continue brewing Brutal for the Horse Brass as well as using it as Rogues premier pour at the 1998 Oregon Brewers Festival. At the 1999 SpringFest in Portland, Oregon, Brutal Bitter was unscientifically voted the Peoples Choice--it received twice as many votes as the runner-up.\n\nBrutal combines Oregon hops with English Malts. The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping. The English malts used are floor malted Pipkin (a mellow cross of Maris Otter and Warboys, from an English company called Beeston), Cara Vienna and Cara Wheat. Brutal Bitter is packaged in Rogues classic 22 ounce silk-screened bottle, 12-ounce 6-pack (new for 2005), and is available on draft.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4208	1072	Kells Irish Style Lager	8	95	5	In 1998 the McAleese Brothers, owners of Kells Irish Pubs in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA, and San Francisco, CA, wanted to make an American beer that would float Guinness. \n\nGerard and Patrick McAleese asked John Maier to create a beer with a green apple bite flavor profile. It took four batches to get it just right. John used acidulated malts imported from Europe to get the crisp, lemony/apple flavor the McAleese Brothers wanted. The bottle label reflects the McAleese family heritage, puctures the Kells Irish Pub logo, and a traditional Irish flutist. \n\nThe first Kells Irish Pub opened in Seattle in October 1983 in Post Alley, above the historic Pike Place Market. The restaurant will remind you of the Old Country with its warm, cozy atmosphere and traditional surroundings. Theres also a patio outside thats a great place to feel the breeze from the Puget Sound and the buzz from the Market. Kells has Seattles largest selection of Single Malt Scotch. \n\nThe Kells Irish Pub in Portland is a local landmark and has been named the #1 Irish Entertainment venue in America. Sit by the fire, belly up to the bar, check out the cigar room, and dont miss the St. Patricks Day Festival, the largest Irish Fest in Oregon. \n\nThe Pub in San Francisco is next to the historic North Beach neighborhood and reflects the Old World charm and hospitality the McAleese family brought with them from Ireland. \n\nKells Irish Lager has won world-wide acclaim by winning 8 medals from the World Beer Championship and a Gold Medal at the Australian International Beer Awards. \n\nKells Irish Lager is brewed with 7 ingredients: Great Western Pale, Crystal, Wheat and Acidulated Malts; Sterling Hops; Free Range COastal Water and Czech Pilsner Yeast.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4210	1072	Rogue Smoke	\N	\N	6	Rogue Smoke(previously known as Welkommen on draft) is a German style Rauchbier (Smoke Beer), which was inspired by the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Most rauch brews are bottom fermented, however Rogue Smoke, is top fermented. It is orange-amber in hue with a delicate smoke aroma and flavor with an intense hop finish.\n\nIn All About Beer, August, 1995 issue, Christopher Brooks writes "Alder wood, indigenous to the Northwest, is the smoking agent, though a small amount of Bamberg malt is used in the mash, too. Beech is drier than alder, reports brewmaster John Maier, so we use a little of that for added complexity. Welkommen, a smoky, nutty ale, is also very dry, which given the 15 pounds of hops (perle and Saaz) added to each 15-barrel batch, is no surprise." The seven medals in nine years which Rogue Smoke won at theGreat American Beer Festival in Denver are also a tribute to this unusual brew.\n\nRogue Smoke is brewed with Great Western Harrington, Klages, Munich, Hugh Baird Crystal, Carastan (30-37 and 13-17), Chucks Alderwood Smoked Munich and Bamberg Beechwood Smoked malts; plus Perle and Saaz hops. Rogue Smoke is available in the classic 22-ounce seriograph bottle (replacing the older 7 ounce bottle) and on draft.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Listed in the Top 500 Ales in the World, Trafalgar measures 6% ABV. Brewed in the Royal Forest of Dean at Freeminer Brewery in the UK and distributed by Rogue Ales in the US.\n\nTrafalgar IPA is a true India Pale Ale, brewed to an original 19th Century recipe. IPA's were brewed at high APV and heavily hopped to enable their preservation on the long journey to the colonies from England. This Ale is brewed from the oldest working traditional floor maltings in Warminster, Wiltshire. The hops are traditional "Goldings" variety grown around Ledbury, Herefordshire as they have been for centuries.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4213	1072	Youngers Special Bitter	1	5	0	Our original Rogue Ale, Youngers Special Bitter (affectionately nicknamed YSB) is a classic English Special Bitter named after Bill Younger of the infamous Horse Brass Pub in Portland, Oregon. The Malt Advocate described Youngers Special Bitter as "rich and flavorful. A triad of caramel maltiness, fruitiness (apricots?), and hop bitterness in aroma and flavor. A fuller malt foundation than some other pale ales, with some background spiciness. Dry, hoppy finish." In the SouthWest Brewing News, Feb/March 1994 issue, George Fix wrote "A strong case could be made for Rogue Ale being included among the top 5 ales brewed in the US."\n\nYSB is amber in color with a mild hoppy finish. Brewed with a blend of 2-row Harrington and Crystal malts, Willamette and East Kent Golding hops. YSB is available in the classic 22-ounce seriograph bottle (the 12-ounce 6-pack was phased out in early 2005), and on draft.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4214	247	Dark Mild	1	10	3.5	To quote Dr. John Harrison, a great influence on my brewing, "Mild ale is the only beer with an uninterrupted history from medieval times to the present day." The "mild" means low hop bitterness, "...which is the only essential feature of a mild ale." They can be light or dark in color, high or low in alcohol, dry or sweet. This is difficult for modern style wiennies to grasp. How can one style be so many things? How can I judge it good or bad?. The current Brewery Creek Dark Mild is medium brown, soft hops and about 3.5% abv. It could be a bit more estery. It is a lovely style.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4215	247	Irish Stout	3	42	0	"Guinness" is the prototype of all modern stouts. Many people, however, don't realize that there are different varieties of "Guinness" brewed around the world. "Draught Guinness* and "Foreign Extra Stout" are the two primary types brewed in Ireland. Foreign Extra is the one I have emulated. It is closer in style to the London Porters of old than to modern stout. Very dark and rich, not as dry as Draught, about 6% abv and around 60 IBUs (that's hop bitterness). I used "First Gold" hops because that's what I could get. Guinness use Nitrogen mixed with carbon dioxide to dispense their stout which adds to the creamy mouth-feel. BTW: The "Imported" Guinness you buy here in the US comes from Canada. It could just as well be brewed in the US but the common wisdom in the brewing world is that Americans prefer "imported" beers and will pay more for them.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4231	905	Fat Tire Amber Ale	3	33	0	Named in honor of our founder Jeff's bike trip through Belgium, Fat Tire Amber Ale marks a turning point in the young electrical engineer's home brewing. \n\nBelgian beers use a far broader pallet of ingredients (fruits, spices, esoteric yeast strains) than German or English styles. Jeff found the Belgian approach freeing. Upon his return, Jeff created Fat Tire and Abbey Belgian Ale, (assuming Abbey would be his big gun). He and his wife, Kim traveled around sampling their homebrews to the public. \n\nFat Tire's appeal quickly became evident. People liked everything about it. Except the name. Fat Tire won fans is in its sense of balance: toasty, biscuit-like malt flavors coasting in equilibrium with hoppy freshness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4371	618	Negra Modelo	8	95	6	Negra Modelo has long been the dark beer alternative for Mexican beer drinkers. It has been identified as one of the few surviving examples of Vienna style lager - a style that was largely replaced in European breweries with Oktoberfest, a slightly lighter lager, in the early twentieth century. \nNegra Modelo pours with an off-white, medium head. The body is clear with a rich amber/copper color. The aroma is sweet with hints of apple. The impression at the first sip is sweet. This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first.\n\nThere is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Gulden Draak is named for the golden statue at the top of the clock tower of the Belgian city of Gent. The statue was originally given to the city of Constantinople by the Norse King Sigrid Magnusson in 1111, during the crusades; hence the form of a Viking ship that the beast was given. During a later crusade, Boudewijn IX (Count of Flanders and Emperor of Constantinople) took it back to Flanders with him because it was so beautiful. In 1382, the cities of Brugge and Gent did battle for the statue. Gent won.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4420	634	Harpoon UFO Hefeweizen	4	50	4.800000191	From Harpoon's site:\n\n"UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer.  Perhaps UFO疚_宊爮仯緛_s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.\n\nThe aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeast疚_宊爮仯緛_s fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.

4428	39	Anchor Summer Beer	11	116	4.599999905	Anchor Summer is the first American wheat beer in modern times. Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.\n\nAnchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting "ale" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.\n\nThe brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.\n\nSummer getaway Wheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and this疚_宊爮仯廮籧ombined with the distinctive flavor of the wheat疚_宊爮仯廮籱akes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage.

Our Lion's Gate Lager has a light body, a very crisp palate and a soft, hop finish, which is imparted by the exquisitely gentle Czech Saaz hop variety. The Lions would approve.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4434	1195	Signature Pale Ale	3	33	0	The term "Pale Ale" dates back to the 1800s when all beer was dark brown in colour. New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4435	1195	Nirvana Nut Brown Ale	\N	\N	0	Our regulars have many reasons for frequenting our premises. Some come for the comfy chairs, a game of pool, or to exude some seriously suaveness at the oyster bar on a Friday evening. For the truly devoted, however, who come in search of truth, it's the Nut Brown they're after. Often they arrive with a glazed look in their eyes, having endured days of office drudgery or the unknowable hardships of securing a parking spot. Set your cares aside, for all can find solace in this ale's yin-yang of nutty maltiness and delicate, dryish hoppiness. For our Nut Brown, an ale deep auburn in colour, we use a blend of Munich, caramel and chocolate malts to create a rich malty palate with a lingering dry chocolatiness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4436	1195	Empress India Pale Ale	3	32	0	During the heyday of the British Empire, India Pale Ale was born as a strong pale ale brewed especially to endure the rigors of the long journey to the colonies. In order to guard against spoilage, I.P.A. was brewed with a high alcohol content and with liberal amounts of hops, which act as a natural preservative. This ale's golden amber colour only hints at its full-bodied flavour. Its sumptuous maltiness is tempered by a goodly amount of bitterness and a mouth-filling hop flavour. In order to finish our I.P.A. with a truly fresh hop bouquet, we dry hop this ale in the serving tank with both East Kent Goldings and Mount Hood hops.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4437	1195	Heroica Oatmeal Stout	1	21	0	There are some things in life that require a certain sense of bravado: these might include ordering a quadruple espresso, deciding to sleep without a nightlight, or choosing to live in a region of the continent that is gradually sinking into the Pacific Ocean. If you're no longer scared of the dark, then there's no reason to be afraid of our stout. A generous portion of rolled oats and lots of black roasted barley give this beer a warm, roasted nose, and a distinct dryness that succumbs to waves of lingering satisfaction.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4438	1195	Pilsner	7	77	0	Our Pilsner is a true beer drinker's beer inspired by the first golden lagers brewed in the Czech town of Pilsn. This full-bodied lager is hopped with copious amounts of Sterling hops, lending it a refreshing, citrusy finish.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4439	1195	Skinny Tire Hefeweizen	4	50	0	Our Hefeweizen is a faithful version of the traditional Bavarian wheat beer. Hefe is the German word for 'yeast' and weizen means 'wheat'. This beer is made with 40% wheat malt and is brewed with a special yeast that tends to stay in suspension, giving the beer its cloudy appearance. Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour. All of these wacky flavours are the natural 'signature' left by this specific yeast strain during its fermentation of the beer and no additional spices are added.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4440	1195	Coal Porter	2	25	0	As you look out over Vancouver's Coal Harbour, relax with this creamy delight. Don't let the colour fool you - this porter is rich but not overpowering with a head that lingers all the way down the glass. Just about anything goes with our Coal Porter, and you don't have to belong to "High Society" to enjoy a glass with oysters.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4441	1195	The Great Pumpkin Ale	11	123	0	A spiced ale that tastes just like pumpkin pie in a glass.\n\nThe Pumpkin Ale is a malty, copper coloured brew that's spiced with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. We add 100 lbs of pumpkin directly to the mash and the resulting beer tastes just like pumpkin pie in a glass.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4442	1195	Sour Cherry Ale	11	121	0	An intriguing fruit beer brewed with fresh sour cherries.\n\nOur Sour Cherry Ale is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with cherries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Montmorency cherries from a local orchard in the Fraser Valley. The result is a most intriguing beer with an elegant cherry perfume, a tart, fruity flavour, and a subtle almondy finish.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4443	1195	Ipanema Summer White	5	67	0	"Tall and tan and young and lovely"\n\nOriginating in Belgium, this is a truly bilingual brew. Known as Biere Blanche in French, Witbier in Flemish and White beer in English. Unmalted wheat and oats are used in the grist to lend this brew its smooth, light body. Coriander seed and Curacao orange peel are added to the kettle to infuse this beer with a subtle, perfumey spiciness. The result is a light wheat beer with a fruity, tart finish - the essence of summer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4444	1195	Frambozen	11	121	0	A ruby-red raspberry beer with a luscious, pink head\n\nOur Frambozen is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with raspberries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Fraser Valley raspberries. The result is a ruby-red fruit beer with a intense raspberry flavour, a nice tart finish and a luscious pink head.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4445	1195	Blitzen Christmas Ale	11	121	8.5	A strong, fruity, belgian-style trippel 8.5% alc./vol.\n\nOur aptly named Christmas Ale is based on the strong beers traditionally brewed by Belgium's trappist monasteries. Trippel is typically at least 8% alc./vol. and has a light golden colour. Because of its high strength this beer has an intensely fruity palate. Up front it has a honeyish sweetness but the finish is dry and champagne-like. Most weary Christmas shoppers would be well advised to benefit from the warmth and 'ho-ho-ho factor' that only a beer of the Biltzen's calibre can provide.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4446	1210	HURRICANE I.P.A.	3	31	0	疚_宊爮佪廮_ complex, flavourful and fascinating ale lies just on the edge of being totally out of control.疚_宊牼暲_ 疚_宊爮仯廮籗tephan Beaumont, Celebrator Beer News\n\nIndia Pale Ale dates back to the 1700疚_宊爮仯緛_s when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4447	1210	Black Plague Stout	3	42	0	Derives its name from the historical fact that at one time in Europe beer was about the only safe liquid to drink. Black Plague is Irish style dry stout brewed only in fall and winter and only in small batches to ensure the freshness so paramount to such an intensely roasted beer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4448	1210	Highland Scottish Ale	1	15	0	While hugely popular in Scotland, this style of beer escapes most North Americans. Designed and brewed by the Scottish punk rocker David 疚_宊爮佪彺郺lty疚_宊牼暲_ Macanulty, this creamy, nutty, malty, dark ale is true to its origins. David drives James crazy over this beer, insisting on rigid fermentation temperatures, traditional mild hops for bittering, and even some weird caramelizing ritual as the kettle is being filled. The beer continues to undergo subtle evolutionary changes because the stubborn Scottish bastard will never be satisfied.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4449	1210	Precipitation Pilsner	7	77	0	A true North German Style Pilsner. Light in body and packed full of Czech Saaz hops. The distinctive Pilsner aroma and dry, refreshing taste make a great accompaniment to a hot Vanouver day.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4450	1210	Fruit Lambics	11	121	0	These authentic Belgian-style ales are intensely sour, dry and complex. All three of the lambics - Raspberry, Blackberry and Black Cherry - are aged in oak casks for more than one year. 15 kg, give or take, of whole unpasteurized fruit is added to each 200 litre oak barrel of fermented beer. The naturally occurring wild yeasts cause a second, slow fermentation, breaking down the fruit sugars to total dryness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4457	1391	Dos Perros	3	29	3.5	Many Mexican beer styles today are descendants of old Austrian styles, from when Austria ruled Mexico in the late 19th century. Our Dos Perros is made with German Munich malt, English Pale malt, and Chocolate malt, and hopped with Perle and Saaz hops. To lighten the body, as many Mexican brewers do, we add a small portion of flaked maize. The result is a wonderfully bready malt aroma, balanced with some maize sweetness and a noble hop finish.\n\nFood Pairings: The toasty malt flavors go great with barbeque, grilled salmon, carmelized onions, and most hot and spicy foods.

4670	1248	Pipe Organ Pale Ale	3	26	4.900000095	When the British introduced draught pale ale to America, the Pipe Organ Pale Ale is what they had intended. It is truly British in character. Brewed with pale ale malt and a touch of caramel malt, it has a light copper color and subtle body. The maltiness is carefully balanced with only the best English hops - East Kent Goldings. Although this beer has a fair amount of hops, the caramel maltiness perfectly balances its profile.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4671	1248	Pious Monk Dunkel	\N	\N	5.199999809	Gold Medal Winner of the Great American Beer Festival. Our beer is fairly dark in color, but don疚_宊爮仯緛_t be afraid. It is a perfect example that dark beers are not always strong beers. The body is surprisingly mellow, and the alcohol content is a bit lower than most people might think. It has a wonderfully clean and roasty aroma. Hop bitterness levels are kept in line, but is has a noticeable hop flavor.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

From the start, you will notice a fine hop aroma. As you sip the Celestial Gold, the subdued maltiness blends with a slight hop flavor. When this beer finishes, you will notice a pleasant hop bitterness. The bitterness will be mild and quite appropriate. Celestial Gold has been known to induce Celestial bliss.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4674	1248	Blast Furnace Oatmeal Stout	1	21	4.800000191	Stouts have typically been a staple beverage in the UK.  There are many variations of stouts available. You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.\n\nAt the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have 疚_宊爮仯屷� and we didn疚_宊爮仯緛_t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.\n\nWe used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\n\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We don疚_宊爮仯緛_t think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4676	1248	Mad Brewer Maibock	7	91	7	A bock beer is required by German law to start at 17帰骶冷Plato.   For those who are interested, 帰骶冷Plato is a measurement of the sugar content before fermentation.  It is a very malty lager beer with medium hop bitterness.  A maibock is a light to amber colored bock beer.  A Maibock is very similar to a Helles/pale bock.  Maibocks were originally brewed for the coming of spring, hence the name Mai (German for May).  The Mad Brewer Maibock is medium amber in color.  Though similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale, it is very different in character.  Don疚_宊爮仯緛_t let it get you though, it疚_宊爮仯緛_s a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose.  The hop bitterness is evident, but not dominant.  The Mad Brewer Maibock will finish quite full and have a delicate sweetness.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio.  I can hear you wondering, what is a hefe weizen?  Allay your fears my friends because I疚_宊爮仯緛_m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

In these chaotic days of shrinking hop harvests, balance is key to a proper IPA. Scratch #12-2008 delivers an intense pine nose married with a subtle wildflower aroma.

It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units. \n\nIt features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.\n\nWe brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado疚_宊爮仯緛_s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\n\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.\n\n--http://www.oskarblues.com/brew/	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4742	956	Dale's Pale Ale	3	26	6.5	Dale's Pale Ale is our flagship beer and America's first hand-canned craft beer. It's an assertive but deftly balanced beer (somewhere between an American pale ale and an India Pale Ale) brewed with hefty amounts of European malts and American hops.\n\nIt features a merengue-like head, a copper color, and a hoppy nose, thanks to a big post-boil addition of Centennial hops. To complement its hoppy first impression, Dale's also sports a rich middle of malts and hops, and a bracing finish. Dale's is 6.5% alcohol by volume, and features 65 International Bittering Units.\n\nWe think of it as the perfect, everyday beer for hopheads like us.

4743	956	Old Chub	1	15	8	Old Chub is a Scottish strong ale brewed with hearty amounts of seven different malts, including crystal and chocolate malts, and a smidge of US and UK hops. Old Chub also gets a dash of beechwood-smoked grains imported from Bamburg, Germany, home of the world's greatest smoked beers. Old Chub is 8% alcohol by volume.  While Dale's satisfies our hop addiction, Old Chub takes care of our deep affections for malt.  The cola-colored beer (almost black) features a tan head, a creamy, skim-milk mouthfeel, and rich, semi-sweet flavors of caramel and chocolate throughout. The addition of smoked grains gives Old Chub a delicate kiss of smoke on the finish.  Old Chub is the beer equivalent of a lightly smoked single malt scotch, or your favorite dark chocolate. We call it Rocky Mountain Mutha's Milk. People who tell us defiantly, "I don't drink dark beer," often fall deeply in love with Old Chub. We can't blame them.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Ten FIDY is about 10% ABV and is made with enormous amounts of two-row malts, chocolate malts, roasted barley, flaked oats and hops. Its huge-but-comforting flavors hide a whopping 98 IBUs that are deftly tucked underneath the beer疚_宊爮仯緛_s mountains of malty goodness.\n\nTen FIDY is the ultimate Rocky Mountain winter warmer, and further proof of the creative muscle of our beloved brewing staff. Look for fourpacks of Ten FIDY in select beer stores in Colorado. Out of state? We hope to send a few cases to a few of our other states in early '08.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4800	1204	Stone 12 Anniversery Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout	\N	\N	9.199999809	Our Anniversary Ale this year stems from 2 pilot beers that were brewed by members of Team Stone. The first was Jeremy Moynier疚_宊爮仯緛_s incredibly delicious Oatmeal Stout, and the second was Jake Ratzke疚_宊爮仯緛_s amazing homebrewed Imperial Stout that had authentic Oaxacan chocolate added to the boil. We loved both beers so much that we decided to combine the recipes to make this year疚_宊爮仯緛_s Anniversary offering: Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. This beer pours deep black with a rich brown head of foam. The aroma is dominated by roast malt and cocoa. Upon tasting, the cocoa (we used unsweetened, unprocessed cacao sourced through our friends at Chuao Chocolatier) really comes through with a deep chocolate flavor and a long lasting bitter finish. The roasted grains used add coffee and licorice accents. It is a thick beer, but not sweet, with the addition of oatmeal in the mash providing a rich, silky mouthfeel that adds to the creamy texture.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
4801	1204	Stone 10th Anniversery IPA	3	32	10	Stone 10th Anniversary IPA harkens back to our earlier Anniversary Ales, with abundant hopping at many stages of the brewing process. Appropriately, the aroma is over-the-top, with pronounced piney and resiny hop flavors combined with tropical fruit esters and more subtle notes of toasted malts and alcohol. Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character. This is a colossal beer, big in every sense: hoppy, malty, rich, and strong! Right up our alley.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

4827	1086	Parking Violation	3	26	5.599999905	Wouldn't it suck to have a job where nobody likes you? And, regardless of your name, people always call you Rita, as in "Lovely Rita?" Sometimes people just shorten it to the simpler "meter maid." The funny thing about that is the Webster dictionary defines a "meter maid" as "a female member of a police department who is assigned to write tickets for parking violations." You have to wonder how the male "meter maids" feel about that! Parking Violation is an American style pale ale using lots of American hops, lots of quarters, and several trips back and forth to the parking lot. So, remember to drink responsibly and feed your meter.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

It is widely held that the darker the beer, the stronger the beer, but this is a summarily false.  The contribution of color comes directly from the color of malt that we use.

4960	1149	Bengali Tiger	3	31	6.5	Sixpoint Bengali Tiger is reminiscent of the century-old English IPA. In my perspective, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors. Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hops疚_宊牼_ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced.

Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.\n\nOur efforts do not go unrewarded 疚_宊爮仯屷� Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness.

4992	1009	High Tide IPA	3	31	6.5	ach and every fall, we experience a coastal experience in San Diego known as the "Super High Tide." This happens later in the Fall Season when the tidal swings reach a range of about 8 feet in difference between low and high tides. When this happens, there are days when the tide just gets too high and flattens out the surf. The lineups shut down and surfers are left to wait until the High Tide recedes.\n\nWhile waiting for the tides to shift in your favor, might we suggest a High Tide IPA? Brewed only once each year to coincide with the Hop Harvest in Yakima Washington, High Tide IPA is made with 180 lbs of Fresh Hops per batch that are plucked from the vines and sent straight to our brewery. We skip the whole drying and processing stage which means the hops are ultra fresh and full of flavors we can't normally get.

5022	314	Wet Hop Requiem IPA	3	31	5.199999809	This beauty is a complete work of art! Bryan and I picked 22 lbs of fresh Cascade hops from 3 gigantic hop vines Bryan has at his house. Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven.

N荆蕦_﹔rebro calls their version 疚_宊爮佪廮_ouble Knot Brown疚_宊牼暲_.  It is the perfect thing to drink with almost any cheese.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5058	1173	Krampus Imperial Helles Lager	\N	\N	9	St. Nicholas, aka Santa Claus, is a magical figure, the bringer of gifts and an icon of holiday spirit. Forgotten by most is his evil side kick and enforcer of 疚_宊爩_鰪賍he list疚_宊爮仯緛_. European tradition says while St. Nick is busy delivering presents to good little boys and girls, Krampus hands out punishments to the bad. A fanged, goat-horned bully, the Christmas Devil uses sticks and chains to beat the naughty children. Dark malts and aromatic hops create the diabolical spirit of this brew. It is finished with lager yeast and aged cold for no less than 30 days. This Imperial Helles Lager will warm even the darkest hearts. \n\nThis season, replace the cookies with a bottle of Krampus.

5063	1286	Scratch #15 2008	1	21	6	Scratch #15-2008 is our first collaborative beer in the Scratch series. We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a Double Espresso Oatmeal Stout.\n\nThe double in the name refers to the espresso (not the alcohol). Scratch #15疚_宊爮仯緛_s espresso blend is a medium city-type roast featuring beans from three continents. St. Thomas Roasters roasted and ground the beans; we used them in our hopback. At the end of the boil the hot wort passed through the espresso beans to give a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor.\n\nChocolate, roasted and caramel malt flavors stand out, while the addition of oats gives Scratch #15 a full, round mouth feel. Galena and Ken Goldings hops are added to balance the overall flavor and not drive up the bitterness. The head retention diminishes quickly because of the oils from the espresso beans.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5065	1142	Chico Estate Harvest Ale	3	31	6.699999809	We wanted to see if we could grow hops at our brewery in Chico, California so we planted our own hop field selecting our prized Cascade and Centennial varieties along with some specialty hop varieties to experiment with. To our surprise, we not only could grow hops, we were also able to harvest them in late summer due to Chico疚_宊爮仯緛_s ideal climate. \n\nChico Estate Harvest Ale is one of the very few estate harvest ales produced anywhere in the world today. All the hops in the beer are grown naturally on the premises of our brewery in Chico. We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle, without being dried, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now, this beer has only been available in draft. Starting this year, we will be bottling it on a very limited basis, with plans to expand its availability as we expand our Chico hop field in the coming years.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5066	1142	Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hop  Ale	3	26	6.699999809	Our newest addition to our Harvest family is Southern Hemisphere Harvest. This is the first time we know of that an American brewer has put out a beer with fresh-picked hops from the southern hemisphere. The inaugural ale will debut in late April and will feature fresh Pacific Hallertau, New Zealand Motueka and New Zealand Southern Cross hops, all from New Zealand. \n\nLike our Celebration Ale, the fresh hops in this beer are dried right after being picked then shipped immediately to Chico for brewing so that they retain their peak aromatics and flavors. To ensure the freshest hops possible, we went to the added expense of flying these hops from New Zealand to Chico so we could brew with them the week after they were picked.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Brewed with Pale, Carahell and Wheat malts, Amarillo and Cascade hops. This medium bodied beer is crisp on the palate with a smooth, not overly bitter hops flavor coupled with the fruity esters from the Belgian Abby yeast strain we used. Its bottle and keg conditioned, so expect a tall, fluffy head, and perhaps small amount of sediment. Just one batch was brewed in April 2008, kegs released in late May, and only 20 cases of bottles for sale only at the brewery at the special debut night event of June 13, 2008, from 5 to 8 pm.

So come on in and enjoy a taste of the Rhineland!!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5133	68	Calico Amber Ale	3	33	5	The Calico Amber Ale was inspired by the beers of England. In England most of the beer is some kind of "bitter".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name "bitter."  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called "bitter" or "ordinary bitter."  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us "best bitter" or "special bitter."  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an "extra special bitter" or E.S.B.\n\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5135	68	Wahoo Wheat Beer	5	67	4	Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is created using the same ingredients that were once used in Belgium. Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or "white" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil. White beers are light and refreshing, yet provide a complex reminder that interesting high quality beer does not have to be bitter and dark. Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is the perfect beer for sunny San Diego.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

This is manifested through the label and packaging designs presented in both English and Thai languages.\n\nPhuket Beer is well positioned as a premium brand located somewhere between the local standard brands and the imported premium brands. The efforts were inspired from the feeling of being in a tropical paradise. Thai beer consumers have become more sophisticated over the years, by selecting and demanding premium and high-end beers. initial consumer target was Phuket Island's significant tourist sector, a sector that is prone to taste and drink locally produced brands.However, strategic positioning and selected marketing of Phuket Beer has resulted in a ray of successful export markets with overwhelming response from the initial markets overseas.\n\nThe philosophy is to provide a 疚_宊爩_鰪賍ropical lifestyle疚_宊爮仯緛_ drinking experience in a fresh clean light tasting lager beer with 5% alcohol by volume, which is in total contrast to the other Thai beers that are very bitter with higher alcohol content.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

According to the legend, a mental asylum for the criminally insane stood in the middle of a dense forest. Surrounding the asylum were seven concentric gates, preventing would-be escapees. One terrifying night, the asylum caught fire, test link causing the inmates to flee into the menacing forest.

5160	1160	Smuttynose Finestkind IPA	3	31	5.599999905	Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.\n\nBut there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. \n\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: 疚_宊爮佪彺詇y don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?疚_宊牼暲_\n\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they疚_宊爮仯緛_ll be quite pleased.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5161	1160	Robust Porter	2	25	5.400000095	This hearty, mahogany colored ale is brewed to evoke the dark, full-bodied ales that were a favorite of dockworkers and warehousemen (hence the name 疚_宊爮佪彺_orter疚_宊牼暲_) in 19th century London. It is a good bet that when Dickens疚_宊爮仯緛_ Mr. Pickwick sat down for a pint, we would have been drinking an ale much like our Robust Porter.This is a smooth and very drinkable beer, characterized by its well-balanced malt and hops, plus subtle notes of coffee and chocolate.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

We hereby pledge to provide him with an ample amount of our Presidential Pale Ale to support in the struggle for the aforementioned goals! Hail to the New Chief!" \n\nSo reads the label of Ale to the Chief, the latest limited release brew from Avery Brewing Company brewed to bid a fond farewell to our current Commander in Chief and welcome a new administration. Our thought process for this beer was rather simple: take the classic American Pale Ale, use American ingredients like West Coast Cascade hops and the American Ale yeast strain (a first for Avery Brewing) and produce a beer in the Avery tradition with intense, in-your-face flavor. This Presidential Pale Ale has a pungent nose of citrusy, green Cascade hops along with a medium body and a lingering bitter finish.

5166	1081	White Horse Hefeweizen	4	50	4.699999809	This German inspired wheat ale is packed full of citrus flavor. We use torrified wheat, pale, and carafoam for balance, giving it a nice hazy, straw color and refreshing wheat taste. We ferment the White Horse at higher ale temps with a German style yeast that is known for producing world class wheat beers. We let the yeast take over the majority of the flavoring in our fermenters, providing the beer with banana and clove like esters. We pull some of the yeast with it to give this brew the proper style and to keep its body and character. We than age this brew with zests of citrus and a brewers spice that blends harmoniously with the esters of the yeast and balance out the sweetness of this brew. Truly a favorite in the summer time for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5167	1081	Lovitz Lager "Watermelon Lager"	8	95	4.5	This summertime lager is both smooth and refreshing as soon as it hits the lips. We take so much pride in it because there is truly nothing else like it on the market. We brew this American Style Lager beer with three types of malt: pilsner, pale and carafoam which enhance the head retention of this beer. We then gingerly scatter some very light floral hops at the beginning to give it some esters and sweetness that compliment the watermelon. The true magic of this beer does not occur in the brewing process but in the conditioning vessel. This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager. Truly our customers' favorite, this one will have you reaching for another glass soon after you put the first one down.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5168	1081	Ludwig's Revenge	\N	\N	5	This brew was inspired by the historical burning of our hometown of Chambersburg, PA in July 1864. During the burning, the brewery in town, "Ludwigs Brewery" operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier, or dark smoked lager. This beer uses all its ingredients from Bamberg, Germany, which is where the style was born and in by coincidence, the same area where Ludwig himself was born and taught to brew. It is made with a special birch wood smoked malt that imparts a light smoky aroma, taste, and dryness to the palate. The pilsner malt and noble German hops are used to balance this dryness making it very enjoyable as well as different. We believe this beer resembles how Ludwig himself might have brewed it over 100 years ago.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5169	1081	Truly Honest Ale	3	33	6	Our signature brew that started it all. This beer is made with four different specialty malts including two foreign caramel malts, a pale malt, and a toasted malt. These malts impart a subtle toasted/sweet taste. This malty brew is than graced with floral and aroma hops which balance the maltiness of this brew and leaves behind a smooth finish on the palate. Top notch ingredients and a truly "Honest" taste makes this a seriously drinkable ale, unlike many other bitter American ales.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5170	1081	Ichabod's Midnight Ride	11	123	6	This Belgian style pumpkin ale was inspired by the legendary midnight ride of Ichabod Crane. It is a Belgian style ale complimented by a light touch of pumpkin and spice. Fresh toasted pumpkins are added in the mash with the grains adding a touch of the season to the brew. The complex fruitiness and dryness of the yeast is enhanced by the addition of sugars during fermantation. The beer is lightly spiced with pumpkin spice, all spice, and brown sugar. The pale and toasted malts used, provide a pie crust taste and smell in the beer as the higher alcohol's produced round out the finish.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5171	1081	Daddy Fat Sacs Imperial IPA	3	32	7.5	The one and only IPA that doesn't leave your pallet with a bitter after taste. This beer took years of practice to get down and when we finally got it right, we knew it. The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added "big sacks" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Liberty Ale is made with the finest barley malt, fresh, whole hops, top fermenting yeast, pure water and the simple natural methods which reflect our exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. It is "dry hopped," a classic ale tradition, and slowly completes its fermentation in sealed vats in our cellars. This unique process creates Liberty Ale's distinctive bouquet and uncommonly delicate, entirely natural carbonation.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

This beer is not made by Monks nor does it resemble fruitcake. Furthermore, Truckee has no Trappist Monastery and that, my friend, is why we at FiftyFifty bring you Trifecta. This is one of FiftyFifty's seasonal ales, and is a high alcohol Belgian style beer. Brewed with inspiration from Belgian Trappist Ales, Trifecta also includes locally grown Purple Sage Honey. With a complex spiciness tempered by the sweeter notes from the sage honey, flavors of spicy sage, alcohol, and mild malt sweetness are apparent, and sage and clove like aromas predominate. Coming in at over 8%, this beer is deceptively strong.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

(My French blood, not so much.) The local, Long Island agriculture booster in me needs to go for the Long Island potato above all others. \n\nWith a brewery this small (basically a home brewery with a license to sell), I can brew what "gets" me, with hopes that some folks will enjoy it.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Chamomile is added for its floral aroma, while the coriander and citrus peel give the characteristics of a traditional witbier.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5473	1246	Saison Rue	5	74	8.5	Saison Rue is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned, Belgian/French-style farmhouse ale. This is a beer of subtlety and complexity, with malted rye, spicy, fruity yeast notes, biscuit-like malt backbone, and a slight citrus hop character. With age, this beer will dry out and will become more complex with rustic notes of leather and earth from the contribution of a wild yeast strain. Being a Saison, Saison Rue is ambiguous unto itself as it is a different beer when fresh and when aged. We hope you enjoy it in all of its incarnations.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5474	1246	Saison De Lente	5	74	6.5	Our Spring Saison is light blonde in color with a fresh hoppiness and a wild and rustic Brettanomyces character. Lighter in color and alcohol than our Saison Rue, yet equally complex in its own way. Perfect for warmer weather and Spring celebrations.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5475	1246	Trade Winds Tripel	5	61	8	Our Summer seasonal, Trade Winds Tripel is a Belgian-style Golden Ale with a Southeast Asian twist. Instead of using candi sugar (typical for such a beer), we use rice in the mash to lighten the body and increase the gravity, and spice with Thai Basil. The result is an aromatic, digestible and complex beer made for a lazy summer evening.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5476	1246	Autumn Maple	11	123	10	Brewed with 17 lbs. of yams per barrel (in other words, a lot of yams!), this autumn seasonal is a different take on the 疚_宊爮佪彺_umpkin疚_宊牼暲_ beer style. Brewed with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, vanilla, molasses, and maple syrup, and fermented with our traditional Belgian yeast strain, this bold and spicy beer is perfect on a cold autumn evening.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5477	1246	Partridge In A Pear Tree	5	62	12	Our holiday beer is a Belgian-style Dark Strong Ale, brewed with our brewery-made dark candi sugar, Munich and Vienna malts.

5478	1286	Scratch #19 2009 Imperial Double Expresso Oatmeal Stout	1	21	9.5	Every beer tells a story, and some are longer than others.\n\nConsider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience.\n\nFor Scratch #19, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\n\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.\n\nSo for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff. Enjoy!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5479	405	Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale	3	33	5.199999809	The first offering from the Coastal Extreme Brewing Company blends some of the world's finest ingredients into a delightful beer. In producing our amber ale, we selected the highest quality European and American malts and hops. This ale has a malt character which is delicately balanced with its hop profile so that consumers of all levels enjoy drinking it. Hurricane Amber Ale is a full flavored beer which clearly has more taste than other domestic and imported light beers while at the same time does not overpower the drinker with heavy body or excessive bitterness. So find yourself a cold 'Hurricane' and ENJOY!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5480	844	Meantime Coffee	2	25	6	Whilst we wouldn疚_宊爮仯緛_t recommend having this at breakfast with your bacon and eggs, our Coffee Beer is made with real coffee and has a caffeine hit to match. The natural flavours of the beans selected and hand roasted by our friends at the Union Coffee Roasters go well with the roast barley in the beer to give a silky-smooth drink with distinct chocolate and vanilla notes. \n\nOur first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo, and, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwanda疚_宊爮仯緛_s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.\n\nAt the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasn疚_宊爮仯緛_t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam. Serve lightly chilled with as many chocolate truffles as your conscience allows.\n\nEach serving is equal to one cup of coffee	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Shocking flavors - far beyond contemporary community standards. We cooked up the straight dope for the growing minions of our nation's Radical Beer junkies. Judges may not be able to define "Radical Beer," but you'll damn well know it when you taste it. Bruce died, officially declared a pauper by the State of California, personally broken and financially bankrupt simply for challenging America's moral hypocrisies with words. The memorial playbill read: "Yes, we killed him. Because he picked on the wrong god." -Directed by, the Courts, the Cops, the Church... and his own self-destructive super ego. Like Noah lying naked and loaded in his tent after the apocalyptic deluge: a witness, a patron saint, a father of what was to come.

German Wheat Beer, with its hints of banana and clove, its delectable, spicy, hops, and its pale golden color, is becoming increasingly popular in America疚_宊爮仯緛_s craft brewing world, and with good reason: wheat beers are both light enough to please light beer drinkers, and complex enough to please true micro-brew connoisseurs. To mimic a classic German Hefeweisen, after pouring your Santa Fe Wheat Beer into a glass, swirl the last few drops in the bottle to loosen the yeast from the bottom, then pour the yeast over the top of your beer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5532	1108	Santa Fe Nut Brown	3	38	5.199999809	The Brown Ale style originated in the pubs of England, where beer drinkers desired a beer that was both flavorful and complex, but at the same time mild enough to be a session beer. The Santa Fe Brewing Company's interpretation of this style uses a combination of high mash temperature, hard water, and low-alpha acid hops to produce a product that is both true to the style and distinctly Santa Fe. Brewing jargon aside, Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale is an easy-drinking beer, mild, smooth, and always a favorite. Try a keg at your next party!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5533	1108	State Pen Porter	2	25	6.400000095	A trademark beer of the Santa Fe Brewing Company疚_宊爮仯緛_s master brewer, Ty Levis, the State Pen Porter has every reason to be one of his favorites. It is flavorful, swimming with notes of nuts and chocolate; it is drinkable, so drinkable that it is almost as if pint after pint were drinking itself.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5534	1108	Santa Fe Stout	\N	\N	5	A hearty sip of the Santa Fe Stout delights one疚_宊爮仯緛_s taste buds first with a generous Irish serving of roast malt that rolls off the tongue with a creamy bitterness reminiscent of the finest coffee. Supported by the complex, yet light body only possible with a good Irish yeast strain, this coffee-like creaminess eventually yields to the warmth of a subtle variety of hops, and their mild, full flavor. A favorite with regular customers, this rare brew can occasionally be found on draft at restaurants in Santa Fe, but is more likely on tap at the Brewery's tasting room. Despite its intimidating dark color, this brew has an uncanny ability to convert those who claim not to like beer. The balance of flavors and complexity of aroma are recognized and appreciated by all who taste this fine brew.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5535	1108	Chicken Killer Barley Wine	3	35	10	Chicken Killer Barley Wine is the revolutionary beer that will someday define America's unique Barley Wine style. It is brewed with twice the ingredients of the Santa Fe Brewing Company's other beers, and only half the usual amount of liquid is extracted from these ingredients. This makes one substantial beer. At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city. If you did not have the opportunity to try last year's vintage, come try this year's!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5536	1108	Fiesta IPA	3	31	6.300000191	A classic beer for those beer lovers who love their hops, Fiesta IPA will take the Pepsi Challenge (or IPA challenge, as we say in New Mexico) against any other pretenders to the throne. Was it divine providence that made this beer the king of the IPA world? Was it a tireless pursuit of glory? No, this IPA has a top-secret recipe to thank for its success, and this meticulously formulated combination of several different hops combined with a very specific brewing process give Fiesta IPA a spicy, citric, and floral infusion of hop character, which is masterfully counterbalanced with the full-bodied maltiness characteristic of the Santa Fe Brewing Company疚_宊爮仯緛_s distinctive beers.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5537	1108	Freestyle Pilsner	7	77	5.5	As its name suggests, this Pilsner does not like to be categorized. Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to 疚_宊爮佪彺県e original疚_宊牼暲_ pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hop疚_宊爮仯緛_s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Company疚_宊爮仯緛_s line up.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5538	1108	Viszolay Belgian	5	60	7.5	Viszolay is a distinctly continental ale with a hint of the southwest. Belgian malt, Bavarian and Czech hops, and a secret blend of German and Belgian yeast strains provide this beer, inspired by the Trappist疚_宊爮仯緛_s Dubbel style ale, with a strong traditional base, while a hint of New Mexico wildflower honey infuses it with that ethereal quality that we New Mexicans simply call, 疚_宊爮佪彺羘chanting疚_宊牼暲_. Like the Trappist ales from which it sprung, Viszolay is light and refreshing. The hop疚_宊爮仯緛_s subtle notes are overpowered by complex fruity flavors derived from the Belgian yeast, leaving Viszolay a very drinkable (yet rather potent) addition to the Santa Fe Brewing Company疚_宊爮仯緛_s family of beers.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

It is brewed according to the classic wheat beer recipe: 60 % wheat malt and 40 % barley malt, top fermentation and in compliance with the Purity Law of 1516.  This dark wheat beer specialty is a natural and spicy beer brand.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5542	1202	Paracelsus Zwickl	\N	\N	5	Paracelsus Zwickl is a natural beer specialty with a mellow impression on the tongue. The aftertaste unfolds a slight bitterness. Zwickl-beer is not filtered and therefore shows some cloudiness due to rests of yeast, minerals and trace elements.\n\nThis very special beer is brewing at its best using a sophisticated recipe combined with love and dedication. Stiegl only uses excellent ingredients from Austrian agricultural suppliers, applying biological techniques. As a result of this Paracelsus Zwickl beer was awarded the Bio-Austria certificate.

5561	974	Doryman's Dark Ale	3	38	5.800000191	Our American Brown Ale has a dark brown color, with a balanced aroma of roasted malts and Northwest-grown hops. The sweetness of the ale and crystal malts blend beautifully with the assertive flavors of Cascade and Mt. Hood hops. A brew to be savored.\n\nThis beer originated as a prize-winning homebrew many years ago. When Darron, the Head Brewer, began designing the beers for the Pelican Pub and Brewery, he adapted his old 5 gallon homebrew recipe to his new 15 bbl (465 gallon) brewery. It was well worth the effort, for not only has the Doryman's Dark Ale been a perennial favorite here at the Pelican Pub, but it has garnered prestigious professional awards.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5549	398	Old Slugger Pale Ale	3	26	5.5	"Old Slugger" is a hearty Pale Ale, copper in color, crisp malty fullness on the front of the palate and lingering hop bitterness on the back with a dry finish.  It is brewed with four barley malts, including two-row English pale and crystal malts, balanced with Mt. Hood, Cascade and Fuggle hops, and fermented in open vessels by Ringwood Yeast, a true top-fermenting ale yeast. "Old Slugger" is the flagship beer of the Cooperstown Brewing Company and was first brewed in July 1995 and bottled in November 1995.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5551	398	Benchwarmer Porter	2	25	6.400000095	"Benchwarmer" is a very smooth Porter brewed in accordance with the original "high gravity" porters of early London. More than 4% chocolate malt, which is the most similar to the brown malts of the early 1700疚_宊爮仯緛_s, gives "Benchwarmer" its dry coffee-like finish. It is fermented with the Ringwood yeast which is an excellent yeast for the brewing of porters. The widely accepted theory of how porter got its name is that it was a very popular beer among the porters who hauled produce and goods around the marketplace of early industrialized London.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5553	398	Backyard India Pale Ale	1	2	6.099999905	"Back Yard" is a golden India Pale Ale. Historically, ale shipped to India in the 19th Century was brewed to higher gravities so that it could mature during the long sea voyage. English brewers also hopped these ales heavily to protect them from spoiling. The term "India pale Ale" or "I.P.A." is still used by brewers to denote a super-premium, hoppy pale ale style. Backyard IPA is no exception. English pale barley malt is predominant in this beer with just a small amount of crystal malt. It is well bittered with Cluster and Cascade hops and finished with a mix of local hop and larger amounts of Fuggle hop.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5558	68	Sculpin India Pale Ale	3	31	7	The Sculpin IPA is a testament to our humble beginnings as Home Brew Mart. Founded in 1992, the Mart continues to be a catalyst for the San Diego brewing scene, setting the trend for handcrafted ales. Inspired by our customers, employees and brewers, the Sculpin IPA is bright with aromas of apricot, peach, mango and lemon. Its lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. This delicious Ballast Point Ale took a Bronze Medal at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the Pro Am category. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting. Ironically, the meat from a Sculpin is considered some of the most tasty. Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Married with other high alpha hops, with almost two pounds of hops added per barrel produced, AIA has an intense staying power in the back of the throat. After a long discussion between Chris, John and the brewers, they dubbed this hop flavor stinky grapefruit with a hint of perfume. The dark color might lead you to believe the some malt may shine through; but no, the hops are the true player in this ale.\n \nScratch #20 has a dual role, also serving at The Drafting Room疚_宊爮仯緛_s Anniversary Ale for 2009.

5618	959	Otter Creek Imperial India Pale Ale	3	32	11	Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.\nOur Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.\n\nThis beer is 11% alcohol by volume, and 135 IBU!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

With every stop he made in Erie came an equal number of stops at our brewery. One extended visit to our fermenter left the engineer in a rather befuddled state of mind. On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree had fallen across the tracks as the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red sports. In tribute to this folklore our expert brewers introduce Derailed Black Cherry Ale 疚_宊爮仯屷� brewed with fresh sweet black cherries and the finest malted barley to create a truly cherrylicious ale.

The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist.

A conspiracy of transcontinental ingredients infused with some devastatingly BrewDog imaginative thinking.\n\nThe flavours, intricacies and nuances of this beer are best enjoyed while musing over some obscure 17th Century philosophical meanderings, such as:\n\n"If we disbelieve everything because we cannot certainly know all things we will do much, what as wisely as he who would not use his wings but sit still and perish because he had no wings to fly."\nJohn Locke.\n\nThis beer is not cool. You may think it is, but that is just a beautiful lie fabricated by clowns and gypsies.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5711	241	Tokyo	3	43	12	The irony of existentialism, the parody of being and the inherent contradictions of post-modernism, all so delicately conveyed by the blocky, pixelated arcade action have all been painstakingly recreated in this bottles contents.\n\nThis imperial stout is brewed with copious amounts of speciality malts, jasmine and cranberries. After fermentation we then dry-hop this killer stout with a bucketload of our favourite hops before carefully ageing the beer on French toasted oak chips.\n\nIt is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time, have excess. This beer is for those times.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5713	241	Tactical Nuclear Penguin	3	43	32	This is the worlds strongest ever beer, ever (yes ever).\n\nNo Penguins  were harmed in the making of this beer; some humans did get very, very cold though. It was worth it.\n\nThe Antarctic name, inducing schizophrenia, of this 徏紝_゜er-imperial stout originates from the amount of time it spent exposed to extreme cold. This beer was initially double barrel aged for 14 months; maturing in the deep, rich oak of Scottish whisky casks. After this epic maturation the beer was then frozen, then frozen again, then frozen again.\n\nThis is an extremely strong beer, it should be enjoyed in small servings and with an air of aristocratic nonchalance. In exactly the same manner that you would enjoy a fine whisky, a Frank Zappa album or a visit from a friendly yet anxious ghost.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

After bottling, we aged the beer for approximately eight months. This allows the tart cherries to push to the front. Subtle vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, coconut and toasted nut endnotes emanate from Splinter Red.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5724	379	Jai Alai IPA	3	31	7.5	Jai Alai IPA is a monster interpretation of an American IPA. In fact, it is so big that it equals the alcohol of some double IPAs on the market. Our IPA uses 6 different hop varietals, with Simcoe hops only being used for dry hopping. The rest of the hop additions are blended at different IBU's (International Bittering Units) in groups of three hops per addition in order to create more hop complexity. At CCB, we love hops but also feel that balance is important for IPAs. So Jai Alai features a sturday caramel malt component which helps to create balance, staving off hop astringency. Ultimately, Jai Alai is a very strong interpretation of a single American IPA. We hope that it makes Tampa Bay natives happy because this is head brewer Wayne Wamble's favorite Cigar City beer and he'd love to share one with you!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5725	379	Maduro Oatmeal Brown Ale	3	38	5.5	Maduro is a Northern English-style brown ale with some American affectations. It is unlike the typical American Brown Ale, as it doesn疚_宊爮仯緛_t have the big hop character common in American-brewed Brown Ales. And Maduro is higher in alcohol than the common English brown ale. Maduro also has oats, in the malt bill which imparts a silky body and aids in making the roasted, toasted and chocolate components mesh together in Maduro's complex malt profile. The end result is a remarkably full flavored yet approachable and sessionable brown ale that pairs well with cigars.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5726	379	Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout	3	43	11	This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Gregory Zhukov. Arguably one of World War II's finest generals and a man bold enough to appreciate the rich, complex flavors of a beer brewed to fortify a body through the Russian winter. Like military geniuses, Russian Imperial Stouts reach their peak with a little age on them, so we release Marshal Zhukov's Russian Imperial Stout in sweltering August so that it will be at peak flavor come January or February.\n\nOpaque black in color, the aroma has notes of espresso, chocolate, dark sweet toffee with hints of black strap molasses. The flavor starts with an unsweetened chocolate character and supporting notes of herbal dryness from English hop varietals. It then moves into dark toffee sweetness and closes with a slap of roasty espresso. Zhukov's Imperial Stout pairs well with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia.  Enjoy, comrade.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Brown in color, Big Sound has huge notes of dark sweet toffee with underlying mild notes of coffee in the aroma. The flavor starts with a slight note of cherry and then opens into a Goliath of a malt character with notes of dark sweet toffee, slight hints of coffee and mild notes of toasted bread in the finish. Big Sound Scotch Ale pairs well with Haggis, Highland Games, Huge Heads and Enormous Pillows and of course Bagpipe music.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5733	1091	Divine Reserve 9	3	43	11	Important: let this beer warm to at least 50帰骶冷 before enjoying.  This beer is black with some ruby highlights.  The nose is full of pumpkin pie spices and some alcohol.  There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla.  The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter.  There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much.  Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer.  As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish.  The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.  The spices will probably fade some over time; they mellowed considerably while still in the fermenter.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5734	1044	Phoenixx Double ESB	1	5	7.199999809	Our winter seasonal is inspired by the great ales of the UK but brewed with a distinctively American attitude. English crystal malt gives Phoenixx its subtle toffee and caramel notes, but this ale is about hops. The blend of English hops, highlighted by its namesake, Phoenix, yields a complex hop character that dominates this special brew.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5739	1	(512) ALT	4	57	6	(512) ALT is a German-style amber ale that is fermented cooler than typical ales and cold conditioned like a lager. ALT means 疚_宊爮佪彺耹d疚_宊牼暲_ in German and refers to a beer style made using ale yeast after many German brewers had switched to newly discovered lager yeast. This ale has a very smooth, yet pronounced, hop bitterness with a malty backbone and a characteristic German yeast character.

Made with Organic 2 Row and Munich malts, plus Chocolate and Crystal malts, domestic hops, and a touch of molasses, this brew has notes of raisins, dark sugars, and cocoa, and pairs perfectly with food and the crisp fall air.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5744	1286	Scratch #27 2010 Cocaoabunga	3	42	6.699999809	Scratch #27-2010 begins a new fold in the Scratch series. For the next several batches individual Troegs brewers will create recipes of their choice. First up, The Ticeman had a hankering for a sweet stout, so the Troegs brothers and all the brewers met with Scharffen Berger Chocolate Company engineers to eat ridiculous amounts of cocoa nibs and chocolates over a few pints of beer.\n\nThis collaboration resulted in the delivery of a special blend of cocoa nibs that were added during the boiling process. In addition to the nibs, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.\n\nDubbed Cocaoabunga, this unfiltered beer has a pleasant cocoa aroma, a subtle sweetness in the mouthfeel, a full-bodied flavor, and hints of vanilla. Enjoy!	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5745	341	Captin Lawrence Pale Ale	3	26	5.599999905	One of the first beers I brewed after moving out to California to begin my brewing education was a Pale Ale.

5748	341	Captin Lawrence Smoked Porter	2	25	6.400000095	A complex beer, with layers of flavors unfolding as this beer slides down your throat.

5749	341	Captain's Reserve Imperial IPA	3	32	9	This beer is a salute to the ingenuity and creativity of the American craft brewers. A uniquely American style of beer, the Double or Imperial IPA, has become the calling card of many craft brewers who aren't afraid to push the limits of what hops can add to a beer. This beer is big and hoppy - not for the faint of heart! Be prepared to experience sensory overload as you savor this Imperial IPA.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.\nThis yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.\n\nHarpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested 疚_宊爮佪彺玡t疚_宊牼暲_ hops.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5769	202	Vigneronne	5	70	5	The name Vigneronne Cantillon was given in 1987.

In order to obtain grapes which are as mature as possible, we buy them at the end of the season. Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of October.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5770	541	Exit 16 - Wild Rice Double IPA	3	32	8.199999809	The fourth stop on our multi-year trip to explore New Jersey takes us to one of the most maligned places in the state- the Hackensack Meadowlands. It疚_宊爮仯緛_s the place usually identified with landfills, pipelines, mob burials (alleged) and sports teams that say they疚_宊爮仯緛_re from New York.\n\nAlthough no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here, we疚_宊爮仯緛_ve brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice, as well as two malts.\n\nRice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops we疚_宊爮仯緛_ve added. Lots and lots of them. We then dry-hopped this Double IPA with even more-generous additions of Chinook and Citra hops to create a nose that hints at tangerine, mango, papaya and pine.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

5842	1394	Old BullDog Extra Special	3	30	5.800000191	A hearty extra special beer or basically a pale ale on steroids.  A dark amber beer with a rich blend of  malts.  The base malt is full kilned pale 2-row barley and is combined with full tasting crystal malt.  This beer has a great heavy late hop addition of East Kent Goldings (that cost us our lunch money for weeks...). ALWAYS AVAILABLE or at least we try.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
5843	1	One	5	65	8	Our first anniversary release is a Belgian-style strong ale that is amber in color, with a light to medium body. Subtle malt sweetness is balanced with noticeable hop flavor, light raisin and mildly spicy, cake-like flavors, and is finished with local wildflower honey aromas. Made with 80% Organic Malted Barley, Belgian Specialty grains, Forbidden Fruit yeast, domestic hops and Round Rock local wildflower honey, this beer is deceptively high in alcohol. 	2010-07-29 14:11:16
5847	1396	Conundrum Red Ale	3	33	7	Have you ever heard of an ESB? In most cases, it stands for Extra Special Bitter, and man is this red extra special. Conundrum walks the line between a malt-centric sweet ale and a hop-centric bitter ale so well, it	2010-11-08 08:45:46

5850	1326	Yakima Glory	3	41	8.699999809	The tenacious grip of big, juicy hop aroma and character slides smoothly into rich, dark malts. This heavyweight battle between fresh, Yakima Valley hops and dark, roasted malts is resolved harmoniously as the flavors merge to deliver complex satisfaction with a warming edge. Bask in the 	2010-11-27 12:29:23
5851	1400	Irish Amber	2	22	4.599999905	Finnegans Irish Amber is brewed with potatoes and three varieties of imported two-row malts. The beer is pale amber in color but light in body. A gentle hop bitterness compliments its complex malt character. \n\nFinnegans is currently available on tap and in liquor stores throughout the state of Minnesota. Finnegans is unique in that 100% of the profits are donated to The Finnegans Community Fund which disburses grants to help the working poor and at-risk youth throughout Minnesota. 	2010-12-03 17:58:29
5852	415	Colonel Blide's Cask Ale	1	3	5.5	A tasty, moderately hoppy, easy to drink beer with an orange marmalade hue with a frothy, off-white head. An herbal hop aroma with a hint of lemon and pine. This beer is not overly bitter, with orangy citrus and pine hop with slight earthy notes! There is a malty biscuit flavor that balances the hops. Makes me wish I had some Fish & Chips!!	2010-12-06 13:08:34
5853	415	Cricket's Nocturne	8	105	4.5	Cricket's Nocturne: a dark lager that combines a mild crispness with subtle toasty, chocolate notes to make it the perfect thirst quencher on days when there's a chill in the air.

Biscuit notes mixing with caramel sweetness.do their job to complement the rest of the flavors.This is an enjoyable seasonal for sure!	2010-12-06 13:12:47
5855	1401	Little Scrapper IPA	3	31	6	To admit that the brewer at Half Pints is a bit of a hophead is an understatement. This India Pale Ale is unabashedly hoppy, not only from the Amarillo hops we add to the brew kettle, but also from the northwest U.S. variety called Cascade that we add directly to the final tank. A firm toasted malt presence forms the background for all of these hops, and we're confident our Little Scrapper IPA could take other so-called IPA's to the mat if called upon to do so. Try it with a curry or a basket of beer battered fish & chips. Serve in a glass at 8 degrees celcius. Unpasturized.	2010-12-13 19:33:36

5857	62	Samael's Oak-aged Ale	1	14	14.5	A super-caramelly, oak-aged English-style strong ale. The oak is very apparent in this rich and high gravity ale. Additional depth and complexity result in a woody and cask-like nose, with a pronounced vanilla flavor on the palate. As of 2007, the use of additional roasted malt has resulted in subtle bitternes to balance the natural sweetness.	2010-12-19 09:47:16
5858	62	Old Jubilation Ale	1	14	8	A winter strong ale with mahogany hue, a hint of hazelnuts and a finish reminiscent of mocha and toffee. No spices, just a perfect blend of five specialty malts.	2010-12-19 09:56:02
5859	144	Fresh Hops Pale Ale	3	26	5	Blue Point Brewing's Pale Ale has a light golden color but explodes with a rich full-flavor. This refreshing ale is top-fermented and hopped at four different stages of the brewing process. English pale malt lends complexity to this brew. Small amounts of Wheat and Carapils round out the malt bill. Brewed to satisfy the hop lover, this pale ale has an immediate floral-citrus flavor that pervades the overall character of this hoppy, quenching microbrew.	2010-12-20 15:32:12
5860	144	Oktoberfest	7	84	5.010000229	Blue Point Octoberfest is another palate-pleasing seasonal brew.

Today, Guinness Foreign Extra Stout is enjoyed by millions of people around the world.	2010-12-20 15:44:53
5863	1149	Sweet Action	11	113	5.199999809	Our most basic interpretation of what makes beer great -- sweetness from the barley malt and active spice from the hops. It is hazy golden in color, with a sweet honey aroma, and a dry, crisp flavor	2010-12-20 15:50:16
5864	1204	Vertical Epic 10.10.10	5	64	9.5	Fermented with the legendary Ardennes strain of Belgian yeast, 10.10.10 is a Belgian Strong Pale Ale brewed with pale malt and triticale (a cross of wheat and rye), hopped with German Perle hops, and steeped with chamomile during the whirlpool stage. In secondary fermentation, we added a juice blend of Muscat, Gewurztraminer, and Sauvignon Blanc grape varieties.	2010-12-20 15:55:46
5865	1271	Imperial Nut Brown	3	38	9.800000191	Commemorating the 10th anniversary of Tommyknocker Brewery, this special brew is meticulously crafted with pure maple syrup, the highest quality chocolate and crystal malts and is accented with the finest blend of European and American hops.

5881	1391	Dos Perros	3	38	3.5	Many Mexican beer styles today are descendants of old Austrian styles, from when Austria ruled Mexico in the late 19th century. Our Dos Perros is made with German Munich malt, English Pale malt, and Chocolate malt, and hopped with Perle and Saaz hops. To lighten the body, as many Mexican brewers do, we add a small portion of flaked maize. The result is a wonderfully bready malt aroma, balanced with some maize sweetness and a noble hop finish.	2011-04-17 12:22:58
5882	1391	Pale Ale	3	30	5.800000191	A new version of an American classic. Our Yazoo Pale Ale bursts with spicy, citrusy hop aroma and flavor, coming from the newly discovered Amarillo hop.

5885	1391	Onward Stout	3	42	3.799999952	The tan lace clings to the glass as you raise the pint to your lips. Close your eyes and smile as the rich espresso notes fade to a dry, roasted finish.

4	Aass Brewery	Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530	Drammen	\N	Norway	\N	47-32-26-60-00	http://www.aass.no	Aass Brewery was established in 1834 and is the oldest brewery in Norway today. It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

17	Alaskan Brewing	5429 Shaune Drive	Juneau	Alaska	United States	99801	1-907-780-5866	http://www.alaskanbeer.com/	The popularity of our beers has led to heroic efforts to keep up with the demand. We claim the unofficial record for production on a 10 barrel brewing system, with a whopping 42 batches in a single week. The addition of a new, 100-barrel brewhouse in 1995, and a Sankey-type keg system installed the following year, finally made it possible for us to serve the entire Pacific Northwest and later the Desert Southwest.  Brewing beer in Alaska isn't easy. In the coastal community of Juneau, without road connections to the lower 48 states, everything arrives and leaves by water or air, and the weather always has the last word.  We have learned to coordinate shipments for barges that couldn't dock in high winds, ferries that broke down, airplanes that overheaded, and trucks delayed by spring thaws that turned the roads to mush. We learned which suppliers were willing to airlift supplies and spare parts on short notice (at $1 per pound). We mastered wiring, plumbing, waste disposal and air quality control. We discovered that, if you had to, you could pour concrete in January by thawing the ground with heaters. Ah, but it all seems worthwhile if you can go home to a dinner of king crab or fresh halibut.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

23	Allagash Brewing	100 Industrial Way	Portland	Maine	United States	4103	1-800-330-5385	http://www.allagash.com/	Allagash Brewing Company sold its first batch of beer in the summer of 1995. The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990's when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales. Allagash began with the release of its Allagash White, modeled after the traditional White beers of Belgium. Also referred to as wit beers, they get their unique flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, Curacao orange peel and the careful sprinkling of coriander and other spices. Allagash combined these ingredients with their very own proprietary Belgian yeast strain to create the remarkably unique and refreshing beer that is today their flagship brand. Allagash White developed a strong cult following around the Portland area where it was available at selected draft accounts. Due to its immediate success, the beer was soon made available in 12-ounce six-packs throughout the state of Maine. With the success of the first brand, Rob realized two things: The public was asking for some new styles and the workload was getting to be too much for one person. Soon after, two experienced brewers were hired and Allagash released their second brew, Allagash Double Ale. Using the philosophy and techniques created by the Trappist Monks of Belgium centuries ago, the staff created this beer using seven different malts, a traditional sugar, and their own Belgian yeast strain. The result was another unique yet balanced beer crafted in the classic Belgian style. To truly appreciate the classic styles and brewing traditions of Belgium, one must experience beer created in the classic Belgian package. This is why Allagash, after an extensive period of research, released their distinctive Reserve line of cork finished 750 ML bottles. This unique line employs the ancient tradition referred to as the mÌÄå©thode champenoise. The technique calls for two fermentations, one in the Brewery's fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself. It is this second fermentation that produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer mouthfeel, and beers of remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle, creating what is known as a living beer. As a result, these styles have a greatly enhanced shelf life and some styles will age exceptionally, much like a fine wine. Just as the styles originate in Belgium, so does the package itself. To insure authenticity, Allagash imports the bottles and corks directly from the same country that designed the techniques. This enables the beers to reach carbonation levels similar to champagne while allowing the corks to pop characteristically upon serving. Today, Allagash still remains one of very few breweries in North America using this distinctive package. From the very beginning, Allagash has strived to produce the finest Belgian-style and experimental ales this side of the Atlantic. It began as New England's original Belgian-Style brewery and has grown into one of the industry's most distinguished and well-respected brands. Following the time-tested brewing traditions of ancient Belgium, Allagash now produces a broad-ranging portfolio of artisanal beers with uncompromising quality.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

42	Andrew's Brewing	\N	Lincolnville	Maine	United States	4849	(207) 763-3305	\N	Andy Hazen is a workhorse of a brewer. From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com	2010-07-22 20:00:20

He, along with Baltimorean, Jim Seay and German beer importer Mr. Wolfgang Stark, styled a beer that would be appealing to the masses, drinkable and enjoyed by both the lager and ale drinker. From the assistance of master brewer Mr. Hans-Martin Walz of Anker Brewery, came The Raven, a beer brewed in honor of Baltimore's literary genius, Edgar Allan Poe. After more than a year operating in Europe, the world's most competitive beer market, production of The Raven began in Baltimore in June of 1998.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

82	Baron Brewing Company	1605 S 93rd Building E Unit L	Seattle	Washington	United States	98108	206.764.1213	http://www.baronbeer.com/	Mike Baker and Jeff Smiley founded Baron Brewing in the beginning of 2003. A brewery has been in the works for sometime. Lots of discussions on what if we had a brewery were had, over lots of good German beer. The opportunity came for us to travel to Germany to really get involved with the German brewing process and ideology - as well as sample the best beer on earth. After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history. We are growing on a daily basis and plan to be around for quite some time.	2010-07-22 20:00:20
83	Barrel House Brewing Co.	544B W. Liberty St.	Cincinnati	Ohio	United States	45214	513-421-2337	http://www.barrelhouse.com	Established as a brewpub in 1995 in the historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company has since transitioned into a regionally distributed microbrewery offering an impressive selection of both innovative styles of ales and traditional lagers. Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the final packaged product.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

87	Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company	429 W. 3rd St	Williamsport	Pennsylvania	United States	17701	570.332.5050	http://www.bavarianbarbarian.com	Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is Williamsport's first production brewery since the 1950's. The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

When we started this project we decided to pursue three businesses.  Just so we wouldn't get bored.  The lodging business includes five rooms at the Inn, and two Cottages on Shake Rag Street.  Then there is the Brewpub Restaurant in the Commerce Street building.  Last but certainly not least is the Brewery Creek Brewing Company, behind the glass doors of the restaurant. Our brewery is a modern, 15-barrel brew house capable of making up to 3,000 barrels of beer per year. I an make ales or lagers, but mostly it has been ales, which tend to have a more complex flavor profile.  I can use a simple one step infusion mash, or more elaborate multi-temperature steps.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

The monks deliberately keep production small, with special care for man and the environment. And because profit is not their motive, they spend the surplus from it on charity work and on people in need.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

It started with Jim, Bill, Sara and Eleanor Carver. In 1986 Jim, Bill and Barb Wynne opened Carvers Bakery / CafÌÄå© in Durango and the Winter Park Bakery was sold.   In 1988 Carvers opened the brewery  making it the first brewery in the four corners region since prohibition. Although still known affectionately by the locals as Carvers, Carvers then became Carver Brewing Company.  Since then Carvers has seen many exciting changes: opening it's outdoor Beer Garden in 1994 and undergoing dramatic remodels in the restaurant and on the patio in '98 and '02. In April of '07 it was deemed necessary to expand the brewery.  The brewery is now housed in the area previously occupied by the bakery.  After 20 years of serving Colorado's mountain folk, Carvers continues to provide the very best in food and beer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

It was thirsty work. And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Finally, curious beer drinkers are stepping out from under the mind-numbing barrage of large brewery advertising and deciding for themselves what they like. Our beers are designed for those curious drinkers. The large breweries use fillers in their beer; Corn or Rice are the most frequently used. Most good beer should be all Barley, in the same way that good hamburgers are all beef. Barley is expensive and the more fillers that are used, the better the profits! Cricket Hill Beers are 100% Barley as are most great beers. Please take the time to taste different local beers. I am certain that those who decide not to let television dictate what they drink are ready for a wonderful adventure into the world of Beer!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

422	Cumberland Brewery	1576 Bardstown Rd	Louisville	Kentucky	United States	40205	(502) 458-8727	\N	Giving new meaning to the term microbrewery, Cumberland Brews may be one of the smallest eateries in town, with a half-dozen four-top tables and a short bar with nine stools making tight quarters of what used to be the White Mountain Creamery. (Techically, it's not a microbrewery but a brewpub - a restaurant that makes its own beer on the premises - but I'm not one to quibble in the face of a good pun.) It's usually packed, too, earning its crowds the old-fashioned way by providing very good food, friendly service, and the sine qua non for a brewpub: extremely high-quality hand-crafted artisan beers. Hand-crafted offerings are produced by Head Brewer Cameron Finnis.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Geary Brewing Company was incorporated in October, 1983 by David and Karen Geary who shared the vision of producing world class products on a small scale for local and regional consumption. At that time, there were only 13 so-called microbreweries in the United States, almost all of them in California and the Pacific Northwest. In the winter of 1984, David Geary began a period of training and research in Scotland and England. With the help of Peter Maxwell Stuart, a Scottish nobleman and brewer who arranged introductions and itineraries, he worked in a half-dozen small commercial breweries from the highlands of Scotland to the south coast of England.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery. Live music and dancing will also be a regular nighttime happening at the brewpub consisting of mostly local bands playing cover type and original Rock, Blues, Jazz and Reggae.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

We use the very best ingredients available. We are efficient and precise in production method, yet we allow the product to age to its full maturity. Balance is the key to our beer.  Alpenhof beer is not created to challenge the senses. It is not created to be a complex beer. Well balanced for Alpenhof means smooth and easy-drinking. The way a beer should taste.  To achieve this well balanced taste, only the finest ingredients are used. We import our malt, hops, and yeast from Germany. (For true German style Lager beer, authentic ingredients are essential!) We might spend more for our ingredients, but it is well worth it. This is an expense you can actually taste!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

509	Estes Park Brewery	470 Prospect Village Dr.	Estes Park	Colorado	United States	80517	970-586.5421	http://www.epbrewery.net/	The original Brewing equipment which consisted of a 4 1/4  Barrel Brewhouse was moved to Estes. For the first summer the Event Center kept the main floor as a stage and dance floor. For the first summer we offered four beers:  Estes Park Porter, Estes Park Renegade, Longs Peak Raspberry Wheat and Estes Park Pale Ale.  In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot. Since '95 we've continued to evolve both in our restaurant and with our brewing operations. In 2003 Tyler Lemirande and Eric Bratrud took over as owners.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Then, using a system cobbled from brewing and dairy equipment, we brewed for our neighbors up and down Puget Sound.

531	Flat Earth Brewing Company	2035 Benson Avenue	St. Paul	Minnesota	United States	55116	\N	http://flatearthbrewing.com/	After years of careful planning  and mortgaging everything  the Flat Earth Brewing Company was brought to life in 2007 by head brewer Jeff Williamson and his wife Cathie. In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

A long tradition that all the German brewers still obey to: In 1165 the first fine for serving bad beer was imposed in Augsburg. From 1487 onwards every brewer in Munich had to confirm on an oath to the ducal Rentmeister of Upper Bavaria, stating that he would not use any ingredients but barley, hops, and water to brew beer. Originally, this oath was valid in Munich only. In 1987 it was renewed by the Munich brewers.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

541	Flying Fish Brewing Company	1940 Olney Avenue	Cherry Hill	New Jersey	United States	8003	(856) 489-0061	http://www.flyingfish.com/	When Gene Muller founded Flying Fish Brewing Co. in 1995, he did so first on the World Wide Web - making it the world's first virtual microbrewery. That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site This Old House meets the World Wide WebÌøåÀå_letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.  He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers. Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order). Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state. Head brewer Casey Hughes now produces four full-time styles, as well as a variety of seasonal beers.   The key word to describe all Flying Fish beers is balance. The beers are full-flavored, yet highly drinkable. Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Hopping is generous, but to style. Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Flying Fish beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, one can walk into any fine restaurant in the Philadelphia region and be pretty sure of finding a Flying Fish beer available. Flying Fish beers were the first in the region to be featured at the Great British Beer Festival, Oregon Brewers Festival and Canada's Biere de Mondial Festival. They have also won several medals at the Real Ale Festival in Chicago, the World Beer Championships and is the only New Jersey brewery featured in the 2000 book Best American Beers.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

635	Harpoon Brewery - Windsor	336 Ruth Carney Drive	Windsor	Vermont	United States	5089	1-802-674-5491	http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/	We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because, like today, we loved beer and wanted more good choices.  While traveling in Europe after college, we drank many wonderfully diverse, fresh, local beers.  We also saw firsthand how important local breweries were to their communities.  After our travels, we asked each other, why not bring great beer and that sense of community to New England?  That was the genesis of the Harpoon Brewery.  Twenty years later we still revel in making great beer and sharing that joy with our friends and neighbors.  The success that we have had running Harpoon is due entirely to the wonderful employees who brew, package, warehouse, sell, deliver, and market our beer and you, the people who drink Harpoon.  We hope that our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

769	Lakefront Brewery	1872 North Commerce Street	Milwaukee	Wisconsin	United States	53212	1-414-372-8800	http://www.lakefrontbrewery.com/index.html	Started in 1987, the microbrewery located on the Milwaukee River has become a Milwaukee landmark.  Its rich history includes partnerships with local taverns, preservation of local historical pieces, unique tours, family style dining options and most importantly, great beer. President Russ Klisch said it all started with his brother, Jim.  Jim expressed interest in beer making near his birthday and Russ humored him by purchasing him a book on the subject.  Jim read the book and brewed the beer.  Although not known, according to Russ, as a gourmet cook, Jim made a good beer.  Russ was impressed and decided he could do it better.  In short, sibling competitiveness and common interest lead both to entering contests in beer making.  They both received awards, and family and friends encouraged them to start the business. Their family had roots in the beer industry as well.  Their grandfather worked for Schlitz driving a street sweeper and a truck.  Russ Klisch remembers him bringing home short fills to his dad.  He recalls, even as a kid, that it was a cool job if you got to bring beer home at night.  Taverns were also owned by several family members. With that family history and their common interest in beer making, the brothers started their business.  They decided to start small.  Initially, they bought an old pizza bakery building down the street from their home in Riverwest.  They liked the location and the fact that they could walk there from home.  They sold their first barrel on December 2, 1987.  They stayed at that location until winter of 1998.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

(OK, make that a young man of 32). As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Unable to stay at home we started Norway's first microbrewery for creative brewing. Some times, when we get a momentary glimpse of sanity, we ask ourselves what we have achieved. We think we can say that we have achieved some level of fame, at least locally and among dedicated beer geeks around the world. But more important - before we started NÌÄåügne ÌÄèÏ most Norwegians did not know much about beer styles like IPA, Porter or Amber. This has for sure started to change, and we do feel that we have contributed to what you can call a renaissance of Norwegian beer-culture.  Diversity was one of our main goals - and it does seem like diversity in the world of beers is starting to come back.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

972	Paulaner	\N	Munich	\N	Germany	\N	\N	http://www.paulaner.com/	The name of the Paulaner brewery refers to the order of friars that resided in Neuhauser StraÌÄüe in Munich who were part of the order of Saint Francis of Paola. The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the GebrÌÄå_der Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas BrÌÄå_u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer BrÌÄå_u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between SchÌÄå¦rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V. (49.9%).	2010-07-22 20:00:20

The brewery and its restaurant are located in the former Eberhardt and Ober Brewery in the historic Deutschtown section of Pittsburgh's North Side, where beer has been made since 1848. The buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Sites. Penn Brewery is an authentic German brewery in every detail; from its solid copper brewhouse imported from Germany, fermentation and aging tanks, filtration equipment, kegging and bottling equipment to its imported ingredients, recipes, methods and German brewmaster. All beers are made in accordance with the German beer purity law called the Reinheitsgebot which means that only the four classic ingredients are used in our beer: malted barley (and/or wheat), hops, water and yeast. Adjuncts such as corn and rice are never used. Preservatives and stabilizers are never used. High gravity brewing is never done. Just real, honest, all natural beer made the way it's made in Germany!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Like the history of brewing in Philadelphia the name Philadelphia Brewing Company has gone through many revivals. The same can be said of our brewery building - the former Wiesbrod and Hess Brewing Company complex in Kensington. At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!	2010-07-22 20:00:20

We started brewing beer as a hobby and as we began brewing more than we could leisurely drink, we really wanted to share some of the incredible brews that we created for fun with our customers too. We installed a 7 barrel brewery and served our first handcrafted beer brewed on the premises in October of 1992. In July of 1997, we celebrated our 10th anniversary by opening another location in Carlsbad. We expanded our brewing capacity into the building next door creating the opportunity to brew, bottle, distribute, and drink even more. Our distribution center is called PORT BREWING!  We found the perfect location in San Clemente and opened in July of 2003 enabling us to brew several additional styles! Let's party! When people started asking where they could get our beer besides Pizza Port enough, we acquired the old Stone Brewing facility in San Marcos at 155 Mata Way #104 to expand our distribution as PORT BREWING! We officially opened on Cinco de Mayo 2006. Now we will be able to make up to 10,000 barrels to get out to your other favorite places to enjoy coldies! More impressive is the 100 plus barrel room for all of our barrel aged specialties.

1013	Portsmouth Brewery	56 Market Street	Portsmouth	New Hampshire	United States	3801	1-603-431-1115	http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/	The Portsmouth Brewery, New Hampshire's first brewpub, was founded in 1991, four years after its sister company, the Northampton Brewery, opened in Western Massachusetts. Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) The brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list. Head Brewer Tod Mott arrived in late 2003, bringing with him is award-winning ways and oursized personality. All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company. --http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/htmlpages.portsmouth/beerlist.html	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1048	Red Oak Brewery	6901 Konica Drive	Whitsett	North Carolina	United States	27377	1-888-Red-Oaks	http://www.redoakbrewery.com	Red Oak Brew Pub was opened in February of 1991. In addition to brewing according to the Law of Purity, we decided not to filter or pasteurize our Bavarian Lagers to ensure the vitamins remain whole for that rich, mellow taste. Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.  By the summer of 2007 Red Oak was ready to open the nation's most modern computerized brewing facility...consistently producing the Freshest, Purest, Bavarian Lagers in America.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).	2010-07-22 20:00:20

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

1266	Timmermans	Kerkstraat 11	Itterbeek	\N	Belgium	1701	3225690357	http://www.anthonymartin.be/	Timmermans brews only traditional Lambic; the basic beer that, from spontaneous fermentation, is used throughout the entire range. Brewing Lambic, without adding yeast, is a complex and subtle art requiring recipes and patience passed on by the family. Lambics survive thanks to a handful of Brussels breweries and the presence of two micro-organisms that exist only in the Senne Valley: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis and Brettanomyces Lambicus. By adding fruit and spices, the magic of traditionallymade beers unravels: Strawberry, Kriek, PÌÄå»che, Framboise, Forest Fruit, but also Oude Gueuze, Kriek Retro, Gueuze, Faro or Lambicus Blanche. A unique site: open daily (including weekends), booking required. Possibilities for your meetings and banquets.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Because we believe that craft beer is best enjoyed fresh, Twisted Pine ales can only be found throughout Colorado. By maintaining only a local presence we feel proud that our beers capture the full flavor and variety of style found at our brewery. It is our intention to bring to you a select family of individually distinctive ales that we as brewers would enjoy drinking ourselves. That is our final measure. We ignore costs, fads, and difficulty in creating our ales. And, while we are very serious about the art and business of beer making, we try to avoid taking ourselves too seriously. After all, we realize brewing a fine beer isn't exactly nuclear physics. It's something far more important. -Twistedpine.com	2010-07-22 20:00:20

Adventures in biking, canoeing, and hiking that led the trio to the northern New England states allowed them to visit some of the first operating craft breweries. Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility. The three have never strayed from their plan to brew and sell the freshest, highest quality beers possible.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

The brewery was founded in 1436 when the brothers Schorer acquired the rights to brew and open a tavern. After establishing property for bottling they soon began brewing on what would become the foundations of the WernesgrÌÄå_ner Pils Legend. It is known as the aforementioned Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period in Germany. [1] Throughout the company's history it has endured numerous changes of ownership. In 1762 the GÌÄå_nnel family bought the Schorer brewery. In 1774 the MÌÄå_nnel family took over the bottling properties. Even though at the end of the 19th century the label now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger Braugruppe GmbH in 2002. The current output is 850,000 hl per year.	2010-07-22 20:00:20

And that true passion in that belief can move mountains and make magical things happen.\n\nWhen we created our first product, FINNEGANS Irish Amber, we made the decision to donate 100 percent of the profits back to the community where it's sold to help alleviate poverty. And we knew it was going to take hard work, unwavering passion, and even a little magic along the way to make it a sustainable effort.\n\nWhat a journey it's been.\n\nFINNEGANS Irish Amber is now sold throughout Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota. Since first being profitable in 2003, we have donated over $150,000 to the FINNEGANS Community Fund, which in turn has given grants to non-profits across the Midwest to support life-changing programs for the working poor. We plan to roll out a new FINNEGANS product in 2011, and eventually have an entire line of FINNEGANS branded products	2010-12-03 17:53:48

Box 1154	Glen Alpine	NC	United States	28628	828-430-6883	http://www.catawbavalleybrewingcompany.com/	The Catawba Valley Brewing Company grew out of a simple gift, and the love of good beer.  A beginner's home brewing kit given years ago began a passion for brewing that could only culminate with production on a larger scale.  It seemed natural to take production from a few gallons to a few barrels and beyond. During the summer of 1999 the business that is now Catawba Valley Brewing Company was born.\n\nIn April of 2007 the brewery relocated from Glen Alpine, NC to downtown Morganton, NC.  In the process we didn't lose a customer or miss a delivery.  In fact we achieved record spring sales.  In addition to relocating we've also opened our taproom to the public.  We encourage those interested in finely crafted beers to stop by and try our selection of beers.  Getting a fresher beer is a near impossibility.	2011-02-16 12:36:49

1414	Black Creek Historic Brewery	Black Creek Pioneer Village	Toronto	Ontario	Canada	M3J 2P3	416 736-1733	http://www.blackcreekbrewery.ca/	Black Creek Historic Brewery recreates the techniques, tools and recipes used by brewers in 1860s Ontario. Our Brewmasters do everything by hand on a small scale. It's a great place to learn about beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.\n\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.\n\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!\n\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today. Either way, you	2011-06-08 07:07:47
